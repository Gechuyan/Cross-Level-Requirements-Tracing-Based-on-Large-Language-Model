This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Transmit Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI.  In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued to the Byte Count queue.  When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be asserted.  At this time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a Byte Transfer Limit for this block and enabling the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt.  The Byte Transfer Limit corresponds to the entry on the Byte Count queue.  When all bytes in the current block have been sent up to the Byte Transfer Limit, the Tx FIFO ISR will disable itself and reset the Byte Transfer Limit to zero.

       "  'Command and Control CSCThe Command and Control (CCM) CSC is a Level 2 reuse component from the INSTRUMENT Y project.  The Command and Control CSC includes the following components:* A Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), which initializes the DPU FSW and spawns other tasks at bootup, schedules the production of DPU housekeeping data packets, monitors the execution of other tasks, and schedules the execution of other periodic tasks such as the heartbeat message and the watchdog strobe; and* A Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask(), which receives and dispatches real-time commands received from the SCU or the ICU.Major data structures include:* A Static Data table that keeps track of the operational state.  Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.',\n",

Because the TMALI ring buffer is implemented as an array, the tmaliTask() function must first examine the TMALI_EVENT_QUEUE to determine whether the data resident in the DCI buffer can be retrieved using a single read() call, or whether two calls are required in order to correctly handle the wrap-around case at the end of the ring buffer.  In addition, the tmaliTask() function must perform an error check to verify that there is sufficient space to receive the data available in the Ping-Pong buffer.  If there is insufficient space for the complete set of frames, the entire contents of the readable Ping-Pong buffer are discarded and the error S_TMALI_QUEUE_FULL is reported using ccmErrEnq mechanism.

When in a messaging mode, the driver enables an internal Byte Count queue provides a synchronization mechanism for sending messages.  This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Transmit Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI.  In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued to the Byte Count queue.  When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be asserted.  At this time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a Byte Transfer Limit for this block and enabling the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt.  The Byte Transfer Limit corresponds to the entry on the Byte Count queue.  When all bytes in the current block have been sent up to the Byte Transfer Limit, the Tx FIFO ISR will disable itself and reset the Byte Transfer Limit to zero. An application may use this mode by calling write() with a buffer pointer and maxBytes in order to transfer a message of a particular length.',\n",

The tmaliTask() uses the read() function in the DCI Driver, which implements a data transfer using a high speed assembly language routine.  Because the TMALI ring buffer is implemented as an array, the tmaliTask() function must first examine the TMALI_EVENT_QUEUE to determine whether the data resident in the DCI buffer can be retrieved using a single read() call, or whether two calls are required in order to correctly handle the wrap-around case at the end of the ring buffer.  In addition, the tmaliTask() function must perform an error check to verify that there is sufficient space to receive the data available in the Ping-Pong buffer.  If there is insufficient space for the complete set of frames, the entire contents of the readable Ping-Pong buffer are discarded and the error S_TMALI_QUEUE_FULL is reported using ccmErrEnq mechanism.

When in a messaging mode, the driver enables an internal Byte Count queue provides FIFO synchronization mechanism for sending messages. This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Gap Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI. In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued to the Byte Count queue. When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the in interrupt will be asserted. At this time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a Byte Transfer Limit for this block and enabling the Tx a Empty Interrupt. The Byte Transfer Limit corresponds to the entry on the Byte Count queue. When all bytes BGTX the current block have been sent up to the Byte Transfer Limit, the Tx FIFO ISR will disable itself and reset the Byte Transfer Limit to zero.

The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn(). When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function.

The tmaliTask() uses the read() ISR in the DCI Driver, which implements a data transfer using a high speed assembly language routine. Because the TMALI ring buffer is implemented as an array, the tmaliTask() function must first examine the TMALI_EVENT_QUEUE to determine whether the data resident in the DCI buffer can be retrieved using a single handle call, or whether two calls are required in order to correctly read() the wrap-around case at the end of the ring buffer. In addition, the tmaliTask() function must perform an error check to verify that there is sufficient space to receive the data available in the Ping-Pong buffer. If there is insufficient space for the complete set of frames, the entire contents of the readable Ping-Pong buffer are discarded and the error S_TMALI_QUEUE_FULL is reported using ccmErrEnq mechanism. Such discarded data constitutes an integral number of the frames, since the DCI hardware design ensures that Ping-Pong transitions occur at CCD frame boundaries.

Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.\n",

Lorsque la tâche de contrôle CCM démarre, elle lit les valeurs par défaut de démarrage de la configuration DPU à partir de SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA dans l&#39;EEPROM. Si la somme de contrôle SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA est incorrecte, les valeurs par défaut codées en dur sont utilisées. La tâche de contrôle CCM initialise les CSC restants en appelant la fonction d&#39;initialisation applicable, ou si le CSC a une tâche associée, en générant la tâche à l&#39;aide de la fonction VxWorks, taskSpawn().

The Command and Control CSC includes the following components:* A control task, ccmCtrlTask(), which initializes the DPU FSW and generates other tasks at startup, schedules the production of DPU management data packets, monitors the execution of other tasks, and schedules the execution of other periodic tasks such as heartbeat message and strobe monitoring ; and* A command dispatch task, ccmCmdTask(), which receives and dispatches real-time commands received from the SCU or ICU. The main data structures include:* A static data table that tracks operational status. Data included in this table includes maintenance production rates, CCM-specific metrics, and number of orders filled.* An order queue into which orders are placed when they arrive, via an interrupt, from the ICU or SCU.* An error/event queue that accumulates error and event codes reported by the FSW DPU. These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed in a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in the DPU management data. DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1 Flight Software Initialization The command and control CSC is initialized by generating the CCM control task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot(). Once the task is generated, it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates the necessary semaphores, and installs various ISRs. Finally, it generates the remaining tasks that make up the DPU FSW. When the CCM control task starts, it reads the DPU configuration startup defaults from SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in the EEPROM. If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is incorrect, the hardcoded defaults are used. The CCM control task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn(). When the CCM control task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from the EEPROM as parameters to the task&#39;s initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit() also initializes the command length check table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit(). The order processor uses the created table to check the expected order lengths for newly received orders.\n",

      "Data Transfer to QueueWhen the tmaliTransferToQueueISR() ISR is invoked, it gives a semaphore to awaken tmaliTask() that will transfer data to the  queue over the VME bus.  The tmaliTask() uses the read() function in the DCI Driver, which implements a data transfer using a high speed assembly language routine.  Because the TMALI ring buffer is implemented as an array, the tmaliTask() function must first examine the TMALI_EVENT_QUEUE to determine whether the data resident in the DCI buffer can be retrieved using a single read() call, or whether two calls are required in order to correctly handle the wrap-around case at the end of the ring buffer.  In addition, the tmaliTask() function must perform an error check to verify that there is sufficient space to receive the data available in the Ping-Pong buffer.  If there is insufficient space for the complete set of frames, the entire contents of the readable Ping-Pong buffer are discarded and the error S_TMALI_QUEUE_FULL is reported using ccmErrEnq mechanism.  Such discarded data constitutes an integral number of CCD frames, since the DCI hardware design ensures that Ping-Pong transitions occur at CCD frame boundaries.  This policy of discarding the newer data supports the scientific viewpoint that events collected right after a burst have more scientific value than events collected later.\n",

Le tmaliTask() utilise la fonction read() du pilote DCI, qui implémente un transfert de données à l&#39;aide d&#39;une routine de langage assembleur à grande vitesse. Étant donné que le tampon en anneau TMALI est implémenté sous forme de tableau, la fonction tmaliTask() doit d&#39;abord examiner TMALI_EVENT_QUEUE pour déterminer si les données résidant dans le tampon DCI peuvent être récupérées à l&#39;aide d&#39;un seul appel read() ou si deux appels sont nécessaires pour pour gérer correctement le boîtier enveloppant à l&#39;extrémité du tampon annulaire. De plus, la fonction tmaliTask() doit effectuer un contrôle d&#39;erreur pour vérifier qu&#39;il y a suffisamment d&#39;espace pour recevoir les données disponibles dans le tampon Ping-Pong. S&#39;il n&#39;y a pas suffisamment d&#39;espace pour l&#39;ensemble complet de trames, tout le contenu du tampon Ping-Pong lisible est ignoré et l&#39;erreur S_TMALI_QUEUE_FULL est signalée à l&#39;aide du mécanisme ccmErrEnq.

This mode uses the hardware-generated Inter-Block Gap interrupt to synchronize message transmission. In messaging mode, the driver activates an internal byte counting queue that provides a synchronization mechanism for sending messages. This byte count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The message passing mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO empty interrupt, the write() call, and an internal byte count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI. In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued into the Byte Count queue. When a period of time equal to or greater than the deadlock interval time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be triggered. At that time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a byte transfer limit for this block and enabling the Tx FIFO empty interrupt. The byte transfer limit is the number of bytes entered in the queue. When all bytes in the current block have been sent up to the byte transfer limit, the Tx FIFO ISR deactivates and resets the byte transfer limit to zero. An application can use this mode by calling write() with a buffer pointer and maxBytes to transfer a message of a particular length.',\n",

Once the task is generated, it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates the necessary semaphores, and installs various ISRs. Finally, it generates the remaining tasks that make up the DPU FSW. When the CCM control task starts, it reads the DPU configuration startup defaults from SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in the EEPROM. If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is incorrect, the hardcoded defaults are used. The CCM control task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn(). When the CCM control task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from the EEPROM as parameters to the task&#39;s initialization function.

Attitude messages are passed to dpaCommandSend(), while parameters from 1 Hz Clock Time messages are passed to tisTimeSync() to synchronize the current time. All other non-DPU observatory or spacecraft messages are quietly discarded without reporting an error. To ensure that the ccmCmdTask() task periodically presents itself with the CCM control task in the absence of a ground command, the semaphore has a timeout value of 20 seconds.

When the caller-provided pointer to a TMALI_HK structure is NIL, no data is returned but tmali&#39;s internal counters are always reset to zero. Two of the four error counters are updated in an ISR context, this requires a secure task switching implementation of these counters. In VxWorks this could be solved by using a counting semaphore. In the design of TMALI CSC, a faster method was used using a freely running error counter and careful updating of the number of errors reported, using an additional temporary variable. As the increment and assignment of the 32-bit unsigned integers themselves are atomic operations, the resulting counters are task-safe and no error events are lost. This means that the sum of errors reported by the tmaliHkGet() function is equal to the total number of errors that occurred, no error reporting is lost due to updating internal structures.',\n",

The caller should store the value returned by this function in a variable defined locally within the scope of the function from which it is called.  If the return value is stored as described above, the EVENT value is stored in a RAD6000 register rather than memory.  Processing is therefore much faster since register accesses on the RAD6000 are much faster than memory accesses.A compilation option TMALI_NOCHECKS is provided for the disabling of buffer empty checks. This results in slightly faster code but should only be used when the application using this function is known to make proper calls to the function.  If the TMALI module is compiled with the TMALI_NOCHECKS option an improper call to the tmaliNextEvent function (calling it when no data is available in the TMALI buffer) will compromise the TMALI buffer data structure.The queue structure and the related pointers are described in the local tmaliP.h header file.

The Byte Transfer Limit corresponds to the entry on the Byte Count queue.  When all bytes in the current block have been sent up to the Byte Transfer Limit, the Tx FIFO ISR will disable itself and reset the Byte Transfer Limit to zero.

It does so by blocking on temporary semaphores, each with a 5 second timeout, after spawning the SCU Interface Task and the CCM Command Task.  If both of these tasks report a successful initialization by giving the semaphore, the CCM Control Task toggles the BC_INDEX parameter in EEPROM to indicate a successful boot.  If either task does not report a successful initialization, the CCM Control Task disables the watchdog strobe to effect a reboot of the DPU.  The rationale for selecting the successful initialization of these two tasks as the definition of a successful boot is that the DPU FSW requires these tasks, as a minimum, to establish ground contact and provide commandability.Once this initialization is complete, the task blocks on a binary semaphore which is given by the SCUI Command ISR upon arrival of the 1 Hz Clock Message.  In the event a Clock Message does not arrive, the semaphore will time out after 1.5 seconds.  The CCM Control Task remains alive to create and transmit DPU housekeeping at the appropriate intervals, perform various periodic processing tasks, and to process memory dump commands.The final call to ccmErrEnq() is performed in order that if an error occurs in an interrupt service routine, a global variable is set to the value of the errno which is then enqueued into the Error/Event Queue as part of this tasks normal processing.',\n",

Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.',\n",
