When a command arrives from the ICU, the icuiCmdReceiveISR() will verify the message checksum and then send an ACK/NAK message to the ICU.  It is possible that an application is in the midst of sending a message to the ICU at the time a command interrupt occurs.  However, since it is not possible for an ISR to take a semaphore, an additional mechanism is required in order to provide mutual exclusion between a task an the ISR.  To accommodate this problem, the icuiEnq() function first determines whether it is being invoked from interrupt context.  If so, it then tests the value of a static variable, icuiEnqBusy.  If the variable is set, the function will save the given ACK/NAK message parameters in static variables and return.  If the variable is not set, the function will continue as normal (avoiding the semTake() and semGive() calls).  In normal execution, the icuiEnqBusy variable is set on entry and negated on exit, after which the static variables containing the ACK/NAK message parameters will be checked to determine whether an ACK/NAK is pending.\n",

Attitude messages are forwarded to dpaCommandSend(), while the 1 Hz Clock Time messages parameters are passed to tisTimeSync() in order to synchronize the current time.  Any other non DPU or spacecraft observatory messages are quietly discarded without reporting an error.In order to guarantee that ccmCmdTask() task reports in with the CCM Control Task periodically in absence of a ground command, the semaphore has a timeout value of 20 seconds.

Commands are executed directly by this task by calling the applicable CSC function* The SCU Interface Task (scuiDPTask) receives telemetry data from other tasks, converts them to CCSDS Version1 Source Packets, forms Company X Telemetry Protocol Data Units (STPDUs) from the Source Packets, and transmits the STPDUs to the SCU via the MIL-STD-1553B Interface.* The Telescope Module Event Transfer Task (tmaliTask) is an Application Framework Software task which is responsible for transferring data from the DCI ping/pong buffers to the TMALI data buffer in response to a DCI frame limit or data timeout interrupt.* The Data Compression Task (dcxTask) receives telemetry data from other tasks, uses a lossless data compression algorithm to compress the data, and then enqueues the data to the SCU Interface Task.* The Data Processing Algorithms Tasks (dpaIMTask and dpaEPTask) process incoming detector events according to the commanded mode, create data products, and enqueue those data products to the Data Compression Task (if compression is enabled) or to the SCU Interface Task.* The Error Detection and Correction Memory Scrubber Task (edacTask) cycles through the text and data segments of the DPU to trigger the correction of single-bit errors which may have occurred, in order to help prevent the occurrence of uncorrectable multiple-bit errors.\n",

The rate is specified in bits per telemetry poll, and has a default of 7664 which is equal to one STPDU per poll (*** bytes per STPDU times V bits/byte).  This default value effectively disables rate buffering.* Size of Low Priority Queue  size in bytes of the low priority telemetry queue.

      "Data Transfer to QueueWhen the tmaliTransferToQueueISR() ISR is invoked, it gives a semaphore to awaken tmaliTask() that will transfer data to the  queue over the VME bus.  The tmaliTask() uses the read() function in the DCI Driver, which implements a data transfer using a high speed assembly language routine.  Because the TMALI ring buffer is implemented as an array, the tmaliTask() function must first examine the TMALI_EVENT_QUEUE to determine whether the data resident in the DCI buffer can be retrieved using a single read() call, or whether two calls are required in order to correctly handle the wrap-around case at the end of the ring buffer.  In addition, the tmaliTask() function must perform an error check to verify that there is sufficient space to receive the data available in the Ping-Pong buffer.  If there is insufficient space for the complete set of frames, the entire contents of the readable Ping-Pong buffer are discarded and the error S_TMALI_QUEUE_FULL is reported using ccmErrEnq mechanism.  Such discarded data constitutes an integral number of CCD frames, since the DCI hardware design ensures that Ping-Pong transitions occur at CCD frame boundaries.  This policy of discarding the newer data supports the scientific viewpoint that events collected right after a burst have more scientific value than events collected later.\n",

      "Public FunctionsThis routine gets housekeeping data stored for the TMALI CSC including some DCI parameters and resets the tmali internal counters to zero.  When the caller supplied pointer to a TMALI_HK structure is NIL no data is returned but the tmali internal counters are still reset to zero.Two of the four error counters are updated within an ISR context, this requires a task switch safe implementation of these counters.  Within VxWorks this could be solved using a counting semaphore.  In the TMALI CSC design a faster method was used by using a free running error counter and a careful update of the reported number of errors, using an extra temporary variable.  As the increment and assignment of the 32 bit unsigned integers themselves are atomic operations the resulting counters are task safe and no error events are lost.  This means that the sum of the errors reported by the tmaliHkGet() function is equal to the total numbers of errors that occurred, no error reports are lost due to the update of the internal structures.\n",

      "Public FunctionsThis function returns the next EVENT in the queue to the caller.  The caller should store the value returned by this function in a variable defined locally within the scope of the function from which it is called.  If the return value is stored as described above, the EVENT value is stored in a RAD6000 register rather than memory.  Processing is therefore much faster since register accesses on the RAD6000 are much faster than memory accesses.A compilation option TMALI_NOCHECKS is provided for the disabling of buffer empty checks. This results in slightly faster code but should only be used when the application using this function is known to make proper calls to the function.  If the TMALI module is compiled with the TMALI_NOCHECKS option an improper call to the tmaliNextEvent function (calling it when no data is available in the TMALI buffer) will compromise the TMALI buffer data structure.The queue structure and the related pointers are described in the local tmaliP.h header file.

The frame depth determines how many frames are read into the selected Ping-Pong buffer before interrupting.  The initial value for the frame depth setting is determined by the parameter provided when starting the tmaliTask.  The maximum value to which the frame depth can be commanded is 64 frames, an attempt to command the frame depth to a value larger than this maximum will result in setting the timeout to the default value of V frames.The actual setting of the frame depth could be delayed by a small amount of time if there is activity on the DCI bus, and is typically changed when the DCI has just reported a frame level reached or timeout condition.  This minimizes the chance of changing the setting while the hardware is close to detecting a frame event.  Changing the frame depth while the DCI CSC is processing data could cause unpredictable results.  When a new tmaliDciFrameDepthSet command is send before the previous setting has been activated the new request will overwrite the previous request and the DCI will be commanded to the new value at the first available opportunity.\n",

This mode uses the Inter-Block Gap interrupt generated by the hardware to synchronize message transmission. When in a messaging mode, the driver enables an internal Byte Count queue provides a synchronization mechanism for sending messages.  This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Transmit Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI.  In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued to the Byte Count queue.  When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be asserted.  At this time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a Byte Transfer Limit for this block and enabling the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt.  The Byte Transfer Limit corresponds to the entry on the Byte Count queue.  When all bytes in the current block have been sent up to the Byte Transfer Limit, the Tx FIFO ISR will disable itself and reset the Byte Transfer Limit to zero. An application may use this mode by calling write() with a buffer pointer and maxBytes in order to transfer a message of a particular length.\n",

Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.'"
