During Boot Sequence 1, ? KB of DRAM is tested before the Bootstrap is copied to this area.  During Boot Sequence 2, the  remaining memory is tested in ? KB blocks. The DRAM BIT first writes the address of each word in a block to that word in the block.   Then the test flushes the cache and reads back the entire block.  If a single-bit error occurs on the read-back, the location is read again.  If another single-bit error occurs, the test assumes a hard error and marks the whole block bad.  If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.  This same process is repeated with the ones complement of the address. The Bootstrap stores the results of the DRAM BIT in EEPROM as a series of x consecutive y-bit words.  Each bit in a result word represents the result of testing a ? KB block of DRAM.  These bits are mapped to DRAM by proceeding from least-significant bit (LSb) to most-significant bit (MSb) as the addresses of the memory blocks increase.

During Boot Sequence 1, ? KB of DRAM is tested before the Bootstrap is copied to this area.  During Boot Sequence 2, the  remaining memory is tested in ? KB blocks. The DRAM BIT first writes the address of each word in a block to that word in the block.   Then the test flushes the cache and reads back the entire block.  If a single-bit error occurs on the read-back, the location is read again.  If another single-bit error occurs, the test assumes a hard error and marks the whole block bad.  If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.

Each bit in a result word represents the result of testing a ? KB block of DRAM.  These bits are mapped to DRAM by proceeding from least-significant bit (LSb) to most-significant bit (MSb) as the addresses of the memory blocks increase.

Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function.

 The DPU-DPA shall perform bounds checking before accessing memory.,"DRAM BITPart of the memory is tested in Boot Sequence 1, and part of the memory is tested during Boot Sequence 2.  During Boot Sequence 1, ? KB of DRAM is tested before the Bootstrap is copied to this area.  During Boot Sequence 2, the  remaining memory is tested in ? KB blocks.

If a single-bit error occurs on the read-back, the location is read again.  If another single-bit error occurs, the test assumes a hard error and marks the whole block bad.  If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.  This same process is repeated with the ones complement of the address. The Bootstrap stores the results of the DRAM BIT in EEPROM as a series of x consecutive y-bit words.  Each bit in a result word represents the result of testing a ? KB block of DRAM.  These bits are mapped to DRAM by proceeding from least-significant bit (LSb) to most-significant bit (MSb) as the addresses of the memory blocks increase.

Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().

Such responsibilities include analog to digital conversion updates, DPU task monitoring, ICU heartbeat message production, and watchdog strobe. The ccmHealthChk() function, called by ccmPerProcess() verifies the execution of other tasks by monitoring the amount of time that has elapsed since each task last reported.  Other tasks report their execution to the CCM Control Task by calling the function, ccmTaskReport(), providing their task index.  Each task has an expected execution frequency, and if a task does not execute as expected, an error is reported in DPU housekeeping.

This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Transmit Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI.

When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be asserted.  At this time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a Byte Transfer Limit for this block and enabling the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt.  The Byte Transfer Limit corresponds to the entry on the Byte Count queue.

  The DPU-BOOT CSC shall create a record of the CPU BIT in the SYSTEM_BLOCK.,"Transmit Message Mode(FIOSSIBGTXMSGENABLE) and Inter-Block Gap interruptsThe SSI Driver CSC supports a message mode to facilitate application level communication.  This mode uses the Inter-Block Gap interrupt generated by the hardware to synchronize message transmission. When in a messaging mode, the driver enables an internal Byte Count queue provides a synchronization mechanism for sending messages.  This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Transmit Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI.  In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued to the Byte Count queue.  When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be asserted.  At this time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a Byte Transfer Limit for this block and enabling the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt.  The Byte Transfer Limit corresponds to the entry on the Byte Count queue.  When all bytes in the current block have been sent up to the Byte Transfer Limit, the Tx FIFO ISR will disable itself and reset the Byte Transfer Limit to zero. An application may use this mode by calling write() with a buffer pointer and maxBytes in order to transfer a message of a particular length.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005608716,0.062379247,0.405465108,0.152265856,34.92125428,15.54481732,155.3803639,52.63122954,1,5.507133663,0.011710621,0.042820496,0.152238067,0.038260604,0.235723798,4.521788577,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.004061484,0.041978866,1.098612289,0.20036722,-8.257401598,-9.149145062,126.1254568,34.25017807,1,8.42005831,0.0659723,1.184913225,8.180565189,0.068339599,0.36006551,5.926926026,0

  The DPU-DCI shall write to the DCI Memory in B-bit words only.,"DRAM BITPart of the memory is tested in Boot Sequence 1, and part of the memory is tested during Boot Sequence 2.  During Boot Sequence 1, ? KB of DRAM is tested before the Bootstrap is copied to this area.  During Boot Sequence 2, the  remaining memory is tested in ? KB blocks. The DRAM BIT first writes the address of each word in a block to that word in the block.   Then the test flushes the cache and reads back the entire block.  If a single-bit error occurs on the read-back, the location is read again.  If another single-bit error occurs, the test assumes a hard error and marks the whole block bad.  If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.  This same process is repeated with the ones complement of the address. The Bootstrap stores the results of the DRAM BIT in EEPROM as a series of x consecutive y-bit words.  Each bit in a result word represents the result of testing a ? KB block of DRAM.  These bits are mapped to DRAM by proceeding from least-significant bit (LSb) to most-significant bit (MSb) as the addresses of the memory blocks increase.

During Boot Sequence 1, ? KB of DRAM is tested before the Bootstrap is copied to this area.  During Boot Sequence 2, the  remaining memory is tested in ? KB blocks. The DRAM BIT first writes the address of each word in a block to that word in the block.   Then the test flushes the cache and reads back the entire block.  If a single-bit error occurs on the read-back, the location is read again.  If another single-bit error occurs, the test assumes a hard error and marks the whole block bad.  If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.  This same process is repeated with the ones complement of the address. The Bootstrap stores the results of the DRAM BIT in EEPROM as a series of x consecutive y-bit words.  Each bit in a result word represents the result of testing a ? KB block of DRAM.  These bits are mapped to DRAM by proceeding from least-significant bit (LSb) to most-significant bit (MSb) as the addresses of the memory blocks increase.

The Command and Control CSC includes the following components:* A Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), which initializes the DPU FSW and spawns other tasks at bootup, schedules the production of DPU housekeeping data packets, monitors the execution of other tasks, and schedules the execution of other periodic tasks such as the heartbeat message and the watchdog strobe; and* A Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask(), which receives and dispatches real-time commands received from the SCU or the ICU.Major data structures include:* A Static Data table that keeps track of the operational state.  Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function.

  The DPU-CCM shall implement a mechanism whereby large memory loads and dumps can be accomplished incrementally.,"Command HandlingCommands are dequeued from the Command Queue and executed by the Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask().  This task blocks on a semaphore which is given by ccmCmdEnq(). The ccmCmdTask() wakes on the semaphore and calls ccmCmdProcess() to process waiting commands.  The ccmCmdProcess() function subsequently retrieves waiting commands from the Command Queue and invokes ccmCmdDispatch() to verify the expected length of the command and execute it.

If the command sent to ccmCmdEnq() is either a 1 Hz Clock Time message or an Attitude message from the spacecraft, the command will not be forwarded to the Command Queue, but instead will be executed directly while still in interrupt context.  Attitude messages are forwarded to dpaCommandSend(), while the 1 Hz Clock Time messages parameters are passed to tisTimeSync() in order to synchronize the current time.  Any other non DPU or spacecraft observatory messages are quietly discarded without reporting an error.In order to guarantee that ccmCmdTask() task reports in with the CCM Control Task periodically in absence of a ground command, the semaphore has a timeout value of 20 seconds.

KB of DRAM is tested before the Bootstrap is copied to this area.  During Boot Sequence 2, the  remaining memory is tested in ? KB blocks.

Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function.

These conditions include a Data Storage Interrupt from within an interrupt context, a Multiple-Bit Error (MBE), and a deferred-work queue overrun.  Under these circumstances, interrupting devices on the Company X Communication/Memory Module must be stopped prior to jumping back to the Bootstrap.  This can be done by installing a hook routine to perform the cleanup in sysHwInit() using the function rebootHookAdd().

The Command and Control CSC includes the following components:* A Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), which initializes the DPU FSW and spawns other tasks at bootup, schedules the production of DPU housekeeping data packets, monitors the execution of other tasks, and schedules the execution of other periodic tasks such as the heartbeat message and the watchdog strobe; and* A Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask(), which receives and dispatches real-time commands received from the SCU or the ICU.Major data structures include:* A Static Data table that keeps track of the operational state.  Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function.

  The DPU-CCM shall strobe the Watchdog timer  by writing to the SCM_WDR at an interval of 1 second.," Startup Sequence On flight, a power cycle can only be effected by the SCU.  A watchdog reset could be induced by the DPU FSW due to a detected, unrecoverable error, or it could occur as a by-product of the FSW entering a state in which it fails to strobe the watchdog timer.  On boot, the bootstrap tests and clears DRAM, and then proceeds to load the DPU FSW from EEPROM and executes it.  The DPU FSW then loads configuration information from EEPROM (which establishes various operational defaults) and spawns the various DPU FSW tasks.

  The DPU-CCM shall strobe the Watchdog timer  by writing to the SCM_WDR at an interval of 1 second.,"Control and MonitoringEvery time the CCM Control executes, it calls ccmPerProcess() to handle periodic processing responsibilities.  Such responsibilities include analog to digital conversion updates, DPU task monitoring, ICU heartbeat message production, and watchdog strobe. The ccmHealthChk() function, called by ccmPerProcess() verifies the execution of other tasks by monitoring the amount of time that has elapsed since each task last reported.  Other tasks report their execution to the CCM Control Task by calling the function, ccmTaskReport(), providing their task index.  Each task has an expected execution frequency, and if a task does not execute as expected, an error is reported in DPU housekeeping.  If the Command Dispatch Task fails to report for an extended period, the DPU will execute a reboot, since it is impossible to command the DPU if this task is not executing, otherwise it will strobe the watchdog",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.004907626,0.088475141,1.098612289,0.27819479,21.59901645,20.08766062,85.26384411,46.33614457,0.995652174,4.766993394,0.032404422,0.356931837,0.550875167,0.04325108,0.400286477,4.744932128,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.004362335,0.042911068,1.098612289,0.181772358,-0.718884473,0,126.1254568,34.71554049,1,8.424735999,0.048341462,1.184913225,4.302390132,0.058078188,0.317743207,5.926926026,1

  The DPU-CCM shall provide the capability to echo to the spacecraft each received command from the spacecraft or the ICU.,"Command HandlingCommands are dequeued from the Command Queue and executed by the Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask().  This task blocks on a semaphore which is given by ccmCmdEnq(). The ccmCmdTask() wakes on the semaphore and calls ccmCmdProcess() to process waiting commands.  The ccmCmdProcess() function subsequently retrieves waiting commands from the Command Queue and invokes ccmCmdDispatch() to verify the expected length of the command and execute it.  If command echo is enabled, ccmCmdDispatch() will call ccmHkMkCmdEcho() to blindly echo the command back to the ground.  Counts for both rejected and executed commands are maintained. If the command sent to ccmCmdEnq() is either a 1 Hz Clock Time message or an Attitude message from the spacecraft, the command will not be forwarded to the Command Queue, but instead will be executed directly while still in interrupt context.  Attitude messages are forwarded to dpaCommandSend(), while the 1 Hz Clock Time messages parameters are passed to tisTimeSync() in order to synchronize the current time.  Any other non DPU or spacecraft observatory messages are quietly discarded without reporting an error.In order to guarantee that ccmCmdTask() task reports in with the CCM Control Task periodically in absence of a ground command, the semaphore has a timeout value of 20 seconds.

  The DPU-CCM shall utilize bootup default values stored in the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM when initializing the FSW,"Command and Control CSCThe Command and Control (CCM) CSC is a Level 2 reuse component from the INSTRUMENT Y project.  The Command and Control CSC includes the following components:* A Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), which initializes the DPU FSW and spawns other tasks at bootup, schedules the production of DPU housekeeping data packets, monitors the execution of other tasks, and schedules the execution of other periodic tasks such as the heartbeat message and the watchdog strobe; and* A Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask(), which receives and dispatches real-time commands received from the SCU or the ICU.Major data structures include:* A Static Data table that keeps track of the operational state.  Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().

 The DPU-CCM shall notify the ICU upon completion of boot and flight software initialization.,"Control and Monitoringthe CCM Control Task initializes the DPU FSW. It is the responsibility of the CCM Control Task to establish a successful boot.  It does so by blocking on temporary semaphores, each with a 5 second timeout, after spawning the SCU Interface Task and the CCM Command Task.  If both of these tasks report a successful initialization by giving the semaphore, the CCM Control Task toggles the BC_INDEX parameter in EEPROM to indicate a successful boot.  If either task does not report a successful initialization, the CCM Control Task disables the watchdog strobe to effect a reboot of the DPU.

" The DPU-CCM shall spawn tasks for DPU-CCM, DPU-DPA, DPU-DCX, DPU-SCUI, and DPU-TMALI at bootup.","Command and Control CSCThe Command and Control (CCM) CSC is a Level 2 reuse component from the INSTRUMENT Y project.  The Command and Control CSC includes the following components:* A Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), which initializes the DPU FSW and spawns other tasks at bootup, schedules the production of DPU housekeeping data packets, monitors the execution of other tasks, and schedules the execution of other periodic tasks such as the heartbeat message and the watchdog strobe; and* A Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask(), which receives and dispatches real-time commands received from the SCU or the ICU.Major data structures include:* A Static Data table that keeps track of the operational state.  Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005353774,0,0,0,17.04724906,0,76.35714104,31.09431077,0.963043478,11.35355542,0.009672537,0.052188697,0.135415515,0.03944629,0.326731667,2.763930659,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003099554,0.036267334,1.098612289,0.184812134,-5.981269731,0,126.1254568,31.9425399,1,9.887249034,0.056371281,1.184913225,10.42868703,0.061444459,0.265168957,5.926926026,1

It is the responsibility of the CCM Control Task to establish a successful boot.  It does so by blocking on temporary semaphores, each with a 5 second timeout, after spawning the SCU Interface Task and the CCM Command Task.  If both of these tasks report a successful initialization by giving the semaphore, the CCM Control Task toggles the BC_INDEX parameter in EEPROM to indicate a successful boot.

The Command and Control CSC includes the following components:* A Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), which initializes the DPU FSW and spawns other tasks at bootup, schedules the production of DPU housekeeping data packets, monitors the execution of other tasks, and schedules the execution of other periodic tasks such as the heartbeat message and the watchdog strobe; and* A Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask(), which receives and dispatches real-time commands received from the SCU or the ICU.Major data structures include:* A Static Data table that keeps track of the operational state.  Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.006199107,0.023850889,0.405465108,0.098339733,13.34527507,7.107206686,85.26384411,40.11328704,0.982608696,5.405981634,0.029585893,0.255626507,0.502960185,0.037003036,0.408343063,3.086704052,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003099554,0.036267334,1.098612289,0.184812134,-5.981269731,0,126.1254568,31.9425399,1,9.887249034,0.056371281,1.184913225,10.42868703,0.061444459,0.265168957,5.926926026,1

After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005889152,0.076024708,0.405465108,0.16344821,29.23766925,22.43732582,155.3803639,57.88362602,1,4.767872048,0.037244755,0.441449409,0.595916078,0.040712038,0.335679632,3.49216916,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003099554,0.036267334,1.098612289,0.184812134,-5.981269731,0,126.1254568,31.9425399,1,9.887249034,0.056371281,1.184913225,10.42868703,0.061444459,0.265168957,5.926926026,1
 The DPU-CCM shall provide a mechanism for other CSCs to report errors for inclusion in the DPU_HK.,"Control and MonitoringEvery time the CCM Control executes, it calls ccmPerProcess() to handle periodic processing responsibilities.  Such responsibilities include analog to digital conversion updates, DPU task monitoring, ICU heartbeat message production, and watchdog strobe. The ccmHealthChk() function, called by ccmPerProcess() verifies the execution of other tasks by monitoring the amount of time that has elapsed since each task last reported.  Other tasks report their execution to the CCM Control Task by calling the function, ccmTaskReport(), providing their task index.  Each task has an expected execution frequency, and if a task does not execute as expected, an error is reported in DPU housekeeping.  If the Command Dispatch Task fails to report for an extended period, the DPU will execute a reboot, since it is impossible to command the DPU if this task is not executing, otherwise it will strobe the watchdog",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005889152,0.076024708,0.405465108,0.16344821,29.23766925,22.43732582,155.3803639,57.88362602,1,4.767872048,0.037244755,0.441449409,0.595916078,0.040712038,0.335679632,3.49216916,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.004362335,0.042911068,1.098612289,0.181772358,-0.718884473,0,126.1254568,34.71554049,1,8.424735999,0.048341462,1.184913225,4.302390132,0.058078188,0.317743207,5.926926026,1

This task blocks on a semaphore which is given by ccmCmdEnq(). The ccmCmdTask() wakes on the semaphore and calls ccmCmdProcess() to process waiting commands.  The ccmCmdProcess() function subsequently retrieves waiting commands from the Command Queue and invokes ccmCmdDispatch() to verify the expected length of the command and execute it.

Once an error code has been reported it becomes the previously reported error code maintained by ccmErrEnq().  A repetition count is then incremented for each subsequent, consecutively reported, identical instance of this previously reported error.  If this error code is reported more than once in one high-rate housekeeping reporting period, then a special error, S_ccm_ERR_REPEAT is enqueued with the repetition count for the error encoded in the least significant byte.

  The DPU-CCM shall maintain counts of both the number of commands successfully received and rejected and report the parameters in DPU_HK.,"Public FunctionsThis routine gets housekeeping data stored for the TMALI CSC including some DCI parameters and resets the tmali internal counters to zero.  When the caller supplied pointer to a TMALI_HK structure is NIL no data is returned but the tmali internal counters are still reset to zero.Two of the four error counters are updated within an ISR context, this requires a task switch safe implementation of these counters.  Within VxWorks this could be solved using a counting semaphore.  In the TMALI CSC design a faster method was used by using a free running error counter and a careful update of the reported number of errors, using an extra temporary variable.  As the increment and assignment of the 32 bit unsigned integers themselves are atomic operations the resulting counters are task safe and no error events are lost.  This means that the sum of the errors reported by the tmaliHkGet() function is equal to the total numbers of errors that occurred, no error reports are lost due to the update of the internal structures.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005121002,0.022525839,0.405465108,0.095569042,19.02582803,0.074483677,93.02747987,35.03374756,0.976086957,5.133743421,0.013204787,0.056345999,0.23768616,0.04008132,0.463226667,2.995732274,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003799453,0.041779928,1.098612289,0.191539069,-7.115559692,0,126.1254568,29.71143747,1,9.208085944,0.053107917,0.476829961,5.735655003,0.057939487,0.233509653,4.540631665,1

 The DPU-TMALI shall be capable of making data available from the DCI to DPU-DPA.  DPU-TMALI will populate a ring buffer with frames of data for application task retrieval.,"Public FunctionsThis function returns the next EVENT in the queue to the caller.  The caller should store the value returned by this function in a variable defined locally within the scope of the function from which it is called.  If the return value is stored as described above, the EVENT value is stored in a RAD6000 register rather than memory.  Processing is therefore much faster since register accesses on the RAD6000 are much faster than memory accesses.A compilation option TMALI_NOCHECKS is provided for the disabling of buffer empty checks. This results in slightly faster code but should only be used when the application using this function is known to make proper calls to the function.  If the TMALI module is compiled with the TMALI_NOCHECKS option an improper call to the tmaliNextEvent function (calling it when no data is available in the TMALI buffer) will compromise the TMALI buffer data structure.The queue structure and the related pointers are described in the local tmaliP.h header file.

The default value shall be M frames and shall be capable of being modified dynamically.,Normal Data Exchange SequenceThe TMALI CSC serves as an intermediate manager of EVENT data supplied by the DCI Driver CSC and eventually delivered to the DPA CSC.  The TMALI CSC waits for notification from the DCI CSC that a frame limit (or data timeout) has been reached in the Ping-Pong buffer indicating the EVENT data is ready to be served to TMALI.   TMALI reads all EVENT data from the DCI and notifies the DCI that it can swap Ping-Pong buffers when ready.

 The DPU-SCUI shall be capable of receiving a telecommand from the SCU every N ms and forward it to DPU-CCM for processing.,"Command and Control CSCThe Command and Control (CCM) CSC is a Level 2 reuse component from the INSTRUMENT Y project.  The Command and Control CSC includes the following components:* A Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), which initializes the DPU FSW and spawns other tasks at bootup, schedules the production of DPU housekeeping data packets, monitors the execution of other tasks, and schedules the execution of other periodic tasks such as the heartbeat message and the watchdog strobe; and* A Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask(), which receives and dispatches real-time commands received from the SCU or the ICU.Major data structures include:* A Static Data table that keeps track of the operational state.  Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005353774,0.036860464,0.405465108,0.119306058,29.81607235,16.51577024,155.3803639,41.88091539,1,5.537516832,0.008442626,0.029123702,0.185737783,0.040400133,0.497859366,6.131226489,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003099554,0.036267334,1.098612289,0.184812134,-5.981269731,0,126.1254568,31.9425399,1,9.887249034,0.056371281,1.184913225,10.42868703,0.061444459,0.265168957,5.926926026,1

" The DPU-ICUI shall install an ISR to be invoked on the SSI receiver interblock gap interrupt, for the receiving and processing of commands from the ICU.","Transmit Message Mode(FIOSSIBGTXMSGENABLE) and Inter-Block Gap interruptsThe SSI Driver CSC supports a message mode to facilitate application level communication.  This mode uses the Inter-Block Gap interrupt generated by the hardware to synchronize message transmission. When in a messaging mode, the driver enables an internal Byte Count queue provides a synchronization mechanism for sending messages.  This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Transmit Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI.  In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued to the Byte Count queue.  When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be asserted.

The results of this test are stored in the EEPROM.  The DPU-RTOS uses the results of the memory test to exclude memory segments with bit errors from the system memory pool. The Bootstrap constructs a bit map which effectively implements a list of failed memory blocks during the bootstrap built-in test.  A set of functions have been created to utilize this  bit map to exclude failed memory blocks from the VxWorks system memory pool.  The system memory pool is used by VxWorks to allocate memory dynamically.  In addition, a linked list of good memory segments is created for use by the EDAC Memory Scrubber.

  The DPU-SSI shall provide the capability for an application program to install a callback routine to respond to the transmit IBG Interrupt.,"Transmit Message Mode(FIOSSIBGTXMSGENABLE) and Inter-Block Gap interruptsThe SSI Driver CSC supports a message mode to facilitate application level communication.  This mode uses the Inter-Block Gap interrupt generated by the hardware to synchronize message transmission. When in a messaging mode, the driver enables an internal Byte Count queue provides a synchronization mechanism for sending messages.  This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Transmit Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI.  In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued to the Byte Count queue.  When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be asserted.  At this time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a Byte Transfer Limit for this block and enabling the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt.  The Byte Transfer Limit corresponds to the entry on the Byte Count queue.  When all bytes in the current block have been sent up to the Byte Transfer Limit, the Tx FIFO ISR will disable itself and reset the Byte Transfer Limit to zero.
