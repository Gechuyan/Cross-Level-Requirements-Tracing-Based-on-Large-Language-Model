During Boot Sequence 1, ? KB of DRAM is tested before the Bootstrap is copied to this area.  During Boot Sequence 2, the  remaining memory is tested in ? KB blocks.

These conditions include a Data Storage Interrupt from within an interrupt context, a Multiple-Bit Error (MBE), and a deferred-work queue overrun.  Under these circumstances, interrupting devices on the Company X Communication/Memory Module must be stopped prior to jumping back to the Bootstrap.  This can be done by installing a hook routine to perform the cleanup in sysHwInit() using the function rebootHookAdd().

  Tthe DPU-CCM shall create DPU_HK_START and forward it to DPU-SCUI at bootup.,"Command and Control CSCThe Command and Control (CCM) CSC is a Level 2 reuse component from the INSTRUMENT Y project.  The Command and Control CSC includes the following components:* A Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), which initializes the DPU FSW and spawns other tasks at bootup, schedules the production of DPU housekeeping data packets, monitors the execution of other tasks, and schedules the execution of other periodic tasks such as the heartbeat message and the watchdog strobe; and* A Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask(), which receives and dispatches real-time commands received from the SCU or the ICU.Major data structures include:* A Static Data table that keeps track of the operational state.  Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005608716,0,0,0,7.361846488,1.503116316,26.06810899,11.73490781,0.994117647,7.71297111,0.007510863,0.025870817,0.090130352,0.042841064,0.57390826,5.135798437,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003099554,0.036267334,1.098612289,0.184812134,-0.311045788,0,56.7518566,12.13363282,1,11.45844262,0.030960711,0.667402216,5.727731487,0.073897037,0.214503692,5.117993812,1
  The DPU-CCM shall strobe the Watchdog timer  by writing to the SCM_WDR at an interval of 1 second.," Startup Sequence On flight, a power cycle can only be effected by the SCU.  A watchdog reset could be induced by the DPU FSW due to a detected, unrecoverable error, or it could occur as a by-product of the FSW entering a state in which it fails to strobe the watchdog timer.  On boot, the bootstrap tests and clears DRAM, and then proceeds to load the DPU FSW from EEPROM and executes it.  The DPU FSW then loads configuration information from EEPROM (which establishes various operational defaults) and spawns the various DPU FSW tasks.

  The DPU-CCM shall strobe the Watchdog timer  by writing to the SCM_WDR at an interval of 1 second.,"Control and MonitoringEvery time the CCM Control executes, it calls ccmPerProcess() to handle periodic processing responsibilities.  Such responsibilities include analog to digital conversion updates, DPU task monitoring, ICU heartbeat message production, and watchdog strobe. The ccmHealthChk() function, called by ccmPerProcess() verifies the execution of other tasks by monitoring the amount of time that has elapsed since each task last reported.  Other tasks report their execution to the CCM Control Task by calling the function, ccmTaskReport(), providing their task index.  Each task has an expected execution frequency, and if a task does not execute as expected, an error is reported in DPU housekeeping.  If the Command Dispatch Task fails to report for an extended period, the DPU will execute a reboot, since it is impossible to command the DPU if this task is not executing, otherwise it will strobe the watchdog",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.004907626,0.088475141,1.098612289,0.27819479,8.166516962,0.707968387,36.06967223,14.58328419,1,4.762171712,0.017527398,0.1735345,0.297965758,0.045609316,0.259719085,4.037186148,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.004362335,0.042911068,1.098612289,0.181772358,0.757007997,0,56.7518566,15.35940425,1,9.764895511,0.037583916,0.667402216,3.344968489,0.072595053,0.285936464,5.117993812,1

  The DPU-CCM shall provide the capability to echo to the spacecraft each received command from the spacecraft or the ICU.,"Command HandlingCommands are dequeued from the Command Queue and executed by the Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask().  This task blocks on a semaphore which is given by ccmCmdEnq(). The ccmCmdTask() wakes on the semaphore and calls ccmCmdProcess() to process waiting commands.  The ccmCmdProcess() function subsequently retrieves waiting commands from the Command Queue and invokes ccmCmdDispatch() to verify the expected length of the command and execute it.  If command echo is enabled, ccmCmdDispatch() will call ccmHkMkCmdEcho() to blindly echo the command back to the ground.  Counts for both rejected and executed commands are maintained. If the command sent to ccmCmdEnq() is either a 1 Hz Clock Time message or an Attitude message from the spacecraft, the command will not be forwarded to the Command Queue, but instead will be executed directly while still in interrupt context.  Attitude messages are forwarded to dpaCommandSend(), while the 1 Hz Clock Time messages parameters are passed to tisTimeSync() in order to synchronize the current time.  Any other non DPU or spacecraft observatory messages are quietly discarded without reporting an error.In order to guarantee that ccmCmdTask() task reports in with the CCM Control Task periodically in absence of a ground command, the semaphore has a timeout value of 20 seconds.

  The DPU-CCM shall utilize bootup default values stored in the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM when initializing the FSW,"Command and Control CSCThe Command and Control (CCM) CSC is a Level 2 reuse component from the INSTRUMENT Y project.  The Command and Control CSC includes the following components:* A Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), which initializes the DPU FSW and spawns other tasks at bootup, schedules the production of DPU housekeeping data packets, monitors the execution of other tasks, and schedules the execution of other periodic tasks such as the heartbeat message and the watchdog strobe; and* A Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask(), which receives and dispatches real-time commands received from the SCU or the ICU.Major data structures include:* A Static Data table that keeps track of the operational state.  Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().

 The DPU-CCM shall notify the ICU upon completion of boot and flight software initialization.,"Control and Monitoringthe CCM Control Task initializes the DPU FSW. It is the responsibility of the CCM Control Task to establish a successful boot.  It does so by blocking on temporary semaphores, each with a 5 second timeout, after spawning the SCU Interface Task and the CCM Command Task.  If both of these tasks report a successful initialization by giving the semaphore, the CCM Control Task toggles the BC_INDEX parameter in EEPROM to indicate a successful boot.  If either task does not report a successful initialization, the CCM Control Task disables the watchdog strobe to effect a reboot of the DPU.

" The DPU-CCM shall spawn tasks for DPU-CCM, DPU-DPA, DPU-DCX, DPU-SCUI, and DPU-TMALI at bootup.","Command and Control CSCThe Command and Control (CCM) CSC is a Level 2 reuse component from the INSTRUMENT Y project.  The Command and Control CSC includes the following components:* A Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), which initializes the DPU FSW and spawns other tasks at bootup, schedules the production of DPU housekeeping data packets, monitors the execution of other tasks, and schedules the execution of other periodic tasks such as the heartbeat message and the watchdog strobe; and* A Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask(), which receives and dispatches real-time commands received from the SCU or the ICU.Major data structures include:* A Static Data table that keeps track of the operational state.  Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005353774,0,0,0,5.421861779,0.215574905,26.06810899,9.5534037,0.964705882,11.51561638,0.005391601,0.025870817,0.075482417,0.044768649,0.354996482,2.650891787,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003099554,0.036267334,1.098612289,0.184812134,-0.311045788,0,56.7518566,12.13363282,1,11.45844262,0.030960711,0.667402216,5.727731487,0.073897037,0.214503692,5.117993812,1

It is the responsibility of the CCM Control Task to establish a successful boot.  It does so by blocking on temporary semaphores, each with a 5 second timeout, after spawning the SCU Interface Task and the CCM Command Task.  If both of these tasks report a successful initialization by giving the semaphore, the CCM Control Task toggles the BC_INDEX parameter in EEPROM to indicate a successful boot.

After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function.

Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005889152,0.076024708,0.405465108,0.16344821,10.84064216,4.524839875,55.7315033,19.27486624,1,4.902494235,0.018660554,0.218833917,0.298568867,0.043299423,0.25747706,2.496741107,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003099554,0.036267334,1.098612289,0.184812134,-0.311045788,0,56.7518566,12.13363282,1,11.45844262,0.030960711,0.667402216,5.727731487,0.073897037,0.214503692,5.117993812,1
 The DPU-CCM shall provide a mechanism for other CSCs to report errors for inclusion in the DPU_HK.,"Control and MonitoringEvery time the CCM Control executes, it calls ccmPerProcess() to handle periodic processing responsibilities.  Such responsibilities include analog to digital conversion updates, DPU task monitoring, ICU heartbeat message production, and watchdog strobe. The ccmHealthChk() function, called by ccmPerProcess() verifies the execution of other tasks by monitoring the amount of time that has elapsed since each task last reported.  Other tasks report their execution to the CCM Control Task by calling the function, ccmTaskReport(), providing their task index.  Each task has an expected execution frequency, and if a task does not execute as expected, an error is reported in DPU housekeeping.  If the Command Dispatch Task fails to report for an extended period, the DPU will execute a reboot, since it is impossible to command the DPU if this task is not executing, otherwise it will strobe the watchdog",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005889152,0.076024708,0.405465108,0.16344821,10.84064216,4.524839875,55.7315033,19.27486624,1,4.902494235,0.018660554,0.218833917,0.298568867,0.043299423,0.25747706,2.496741107,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.004362335,0.042911068,1.098612289,0.181772358,0.757007997,0,56.7518566,15.35940425,1,9.764895511,0.037583916,0.667402216,3.344968489,0.072595053,0.285936464,5.117993812,1

This task blocks on a semaphore which is given by ccmCmdEnq(). The ccmCmdTask() wakes on the semaphore and calls ccmCmdProcess() to process waiting commands.

  The DPU-CCM shall maintain counts of both the number of commands successfully received and rejected and report the parameters in DPU_HK.,"Error Collection and ReportingThe ccmErrEnq() function tracks the last error reported and its frequency of occurrence.  Once an error code has been reported it becomes the previously reported error code maintained by ccmErrEnq().  A repetition count is then incremented for each subsequent, consecutively reported, identical instance of this previously reported error.  If this error code is reported more than once in one high-rate housekeeping reporting period, then a special error, S_ccm_ERR_REPEAT is enqueued with the repetition count for the error encoded in the least significant byte.

  The DPU-CCM shall maintain counts of both the number of commands successfully received and rejected and report the parameters in DPU_HK.,"Public FunctionsThis routine gets housekeeping data stored for the TMALI CSC including some DCI parameters and resets the tmali internal counters to zero.  When the caller supplied pointer to a TMALI_HK structure is NIL no data is returned but the tmali internal counters are still reset to zero.Two of the four error counters are updated within an ISR context, this requires a task switch safe implementation of these counters.  Within VxWorks this could be solved using a counting semaphore.  In the TMALI CSC design a faster method was used by using a free running error counter and a careful update of the reported number of errors, using an extra temporary variable.  As the increment and assignment of the 32 bit unsigned integers themselves are atomic operations the resulting counters are task safe and no error events are lost.  This means that the sum of the errors reported by the tmaliHkGet() function is equal to the total numbers of errors that occurred, no error reports are lost due to the update of the internal structures.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005121002,0.022525839,0.405465108,0.095569042,7.944436094,2.976764986,37.19341445,12.33406113,0.994117647,5.178684554,0.005923842,0.031977372,0.106629151,0.04458042,0.337634446,2.496741107,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003799453,0.041779928,1.098612289,0.191539069,0.854928886,0,56.7518566,9.860318658,1,10.91659713,0.01858626,0.264096993,2.00731606,0.070066873,0.192161671,4.019381524,1

 The DPU-TMALI shall be capable of making data available from the DCI to DPU-DPA.  DPU-TMALI will populate a ring buffer with frames of data for application task retrieval.,"Public FunctionsThis function returns the next EVENT in the queue to the caller.  The caller should store the value returned by this function in a variable defined locally within the scope of the function from which it is called.  If the return value is stored as described above, the EVENT value is stored in a RAD6000 register rather than memory.  Processing is therefore much faster since register accesses on the RAD6000 are much faster than memory accesses.A compilation option TMALI_NOCHECKS is provided for the disabling of buffer empty checks. This results in slightly faster code but should only be used when the application using this function is known to make proper calls to the function.  If the TMALI module is compiled with the TMALI_NOCHECKS option an improper call to the tmaliNextEvent function (calling it when no data is available in the TMALI buffer) will compromise the TMALI buffer data structure.The queue structure and the related pointers are described in the local tmaliP.h header file.

If a single-bit error occurs on the read-back, the location is read again.  If another single-bit error occurs, the test assumes a hard error and marks the whole block bad.  If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.

 The DPU-SCUI shall be capable of receiving a telecommand from the SCU every N ms and forward it to DPU-CCM for processing.,"Command and Control CSCThe Command and Control (CCM) CSC is a Level 2 reuse component from the INSTRUMENT Y project.  The Command and Control CSC includes the following components:* A Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), which initializes the DPU FSW and spawns other tasks at bootup, schedules the production of DPU housekeeping data packets, monitors the execution of other tasks, and schedules the execution of other periodic tasks such as the heartbeat message and the watchdog strobe; and* A Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask(), which receives and dispatches real-time commands received from the SCU or the ICU.Major data structures include:* A Static Data table that keeps track of the operational state.  Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005353774,0.036860464,0.405465108,0.119306058,10.95008845,8.27701718,55.7315033,14.2577115,1,6.754929398,0.004616573,0.023582646,0.101564607,0.043532628,0.321535922,5.135798437,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003099554,0.036267334,1.098612289,0.184812134,-0.311045788,0,56.7518566,12.13363282,1,11.45844262,0.030960711,0.667402216,5.727731487,0.073897037,0.214503692,5.117993812,1

The error queue semaphore has priority inversion set to reduce conflicts between multiple callers should a priority inversion situation arise.

" The DPU-ICUI shall install an ISR to be invoked on the SSI receiver interblock gap interrupt, for the receiving and processing of commands from the ICU.","Transmit Message Mode(FIOSSIBGTXMSGENABLE) and Inter-Block Gap interruptsThe SSI Driver CSC supports a message mode to facilitate application level communication.  This mode uses the Inter-Block Gap interrupt generated by the hardware to synchronize message transmission. When in a messaging mode, the driver enables an internal Byte Count queue provides a synchronization mechanism for sending messages.  This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Transmit Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI.  In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued to the Byte Count queue.  When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be asserted.  At this time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a Byte Transfer Limit for this block and enabling the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt.

The results of this test are stored in the EEPROM.  The DPU-RTOS uses the results of the memory test to exclude memory segments with bit errors from the system memory pool. The Bootstrap constructs a bit map which effectively implements a list of failed memory blocks during the bootstrap built-in test.  A set of functions have been created to utilize this  bit map to exclude failed memory blocks from the VxWorks system memory pool.  The system memory pool is used by VxWorks to allocate memory dynamically.  In addition, a linked list of good memory segments is created for use by the EDAC Memory Scrubber.  These functions are called from the usrInit() and usrRoot() functions in usrConfig.c.  The dramInit() function must be called prior to kernelInit() in usrInit().

  The DPU-SSI shall provide the capability for an application program to install a callback routine to respond to the transmit IBG Interrupt.,"Transmit Message Mode(FIOSSIBGTXMSGENABLE) and Inter-Block Gap interruptsThe SSI Driver CSC supports a message mode to facilitate application level communication.  This mode uses the Inter-Block Gap interrupt generated by the hardware to synchronize message transmission. When in a messaging mode, the driver enables an internal Byte Count queue provides a synchronization mechanism for sending messages.  This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Transmit Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI.  In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued to the Byte Count queue.  When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be asserted.  At this time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a Byte Transfer Limit for this block and enabling the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt.  The Byte Transfer Limit corresponds to the entry on the Byte Count queue.  When all bytes in the current block have been sent up to the Byte Transfer Limit, the Tx FIFO ISR will disable itself and reset the Byte Transfer Limit to zero.

These conditions include a Data Storage Interrupt from within an interrupt context, a Multiple-Bit Error (MBE), and a deferred-work queue overrun.

This can be done by installing a hook routine to perform the cleanup in sysHwInit() using the function rebootHookAdd().

  The DPU-RTOS shall provide a function to allow an application program to read from the Real-Time Clock registers on the RAD6000SC CPU Module.,"Public FunctionsThis function sets the frame depth of the Ping-Pong buffers used by the DCI CSC.  The frame depth determines how many frames are read into the selected Ping-Pong buffer before interrupting.  The initial value for the frame depth setting is determined by the parameter provided when starting the tmaliTask.  The maximum value to which the frame depth can be commanded is 64 frames, an attempt to command the frame depth to a value larger than this maximum will result in setting the timeout to the default value of V frames.The actual setting of the frame depth could be delayed by a small amount of time if there is activity on the DCI bus, and is typically changed when the DCI has just reported a frame level reached or timeout condition.  This minimizes the chance of changing the setting while the hardware is close to detecting a frame event.  Changing the frame depth while the DCI CSC is processing data could cause unpredictable results.

  The DPU-BOOT CSC shall provide a monitor which accepts commands over the RS-232 interface.,"Transmit Message Mode(FIOSSIBGTXMSGENABLE) and Inter-Block Gap interruptsThe SSI Driver CSC supports a message mode to facilitate application level communication.  This mode uses the Inter-Block Gap interrupt generated by the hardware to synchronize message transmission. When in a messaging mode, the driver enables an internal Byte Count queue provides a synchronization mechanism for sending messages.  This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Transmit Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI.  In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued to the Byte Count queue.  When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be asserted.  At this time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a Byte Transfer Limit for this block and enabling the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt.  The Byte Transfer Limit corresponds to the entry on the Byte Count queue.  When all bytes in the current block have been sent up to the Byte Transfer Limit, the Tx FIFO ISR will disable itself and reset the Byte Transfer Limit to zero. An application may use this mode by calling write() with a buffer pointer and maxBytes in order to transfer a message of a particular length.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005353774,0.057923587,0.405465108,0.147239188,9.118301175,2.209984076,55.7315033,17.10963449,1,6.081518638,0.008794192,0.033944908,0.123118693,0.045334593,0.399233743,4.442651256,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.004061484,0.041978866,1.098612289,0.20036722,-0.84391981,0,56.7518566,13.53167283,1,10.12546911,0.038989226,0.667402216,4.834664027,0.065396363,0.275888314,5.117993812,0

The results of this test are stored in the EEPROM.  The DPU-RTOS uses the results of the memory test to exclude memory segments with bit errors from the system memory pool. The Bootstrap constructs a bit map which effectively implements a list of failed memory blocks during the bootstrap built-in test.  A set of functions have been created to utilize this  bit map to exclude failed memory blocks from the VxWorks system memory pool.  The system memory pool is used by VxWorks to allocate memory dynamically.  In addition, a linked list of good memory segments is created for use by the EDAC Memory Scrubber.

This driver is patterned after the older VxWorks 5.2 serial driver architecture rather than the newer Tornado serial driver architecture due to the lack of programmer control over I/O in the newer Tornado driver architecture. ,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005889152,0.036860464,0.405465108,0.12225233,8.299993139,7.351211446,36.06967223,10.42710217,0.958823529,5.948160106,0.001559412,0.003749059,0.017153534,0.044310454,0.261333041,1.957744607,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003926101,0.065186779,1.098612289,0.243692822,2.925991533,0,56.7518566,13.2141752,1,11.22066503,0.018543449,0.324992878,1.168237291,0.066948628,0.225778705,3.172083663,0
  The DPU-BOOT CSC shall create a record of the CPU BIT in the SYSTEM_BLOCK.,"InitializationThe driver is initialized by invoking the initialization function adcInit().  The function initializes the ADC_LIST_ENTRY array, sets up convenience pointers to the ADC hardware registers, and sets up the ADC multiplexer for the first conversion (otherwise the very first ADC value requires three calls to adcUpdateNext()).  The ADC Driver can be re-initialized, which will result in the values in the ADC_LIST_ENTRY array being reset to their default values.The ADC_VALUEs are A-bit data items; however the hardware contains a B-bit A/D.  The upper bits are used to indicate invalid or suspect values as follows:* At initialization, the MSbit of each of the ADC_VALUEs is set (0x8000).* If a conversion fails (i.e. the driver reads the analog value and determines that the conversion has not yet completed), the second MSbit.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005608716,0.062379247,0.405465108,0.152265856,13.05968754,3.85346669,55.7315033,18.74764423,1,6.746706552,0.005286297,0.023582646,0.068721858,0.040327867,0.236689596,3.526360525,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003271751,0.026306905,1.098612289,0.137266171,0.831493491,0,56.7518566,13.1264578,1,10.3543629,0.027554895,0.324992878,2.424830726,0.068552511,0.36067968,5.117993812,0

The image mode shall shift successive frames according to the calculated spacecraft drift and co-add the frame into an accumulated image.,"Public FunctionsThis routine gets housekeeping data stored for the TMALI CSC including some DCI parameters and resets the tmali internal counters to zero.  When the caller supplied pointer to a TMALI_HK structure is NIL no data is returned but the tmali internal counters are still reset to zero.Two of the four error counters are updated within an ISR context, this requires a task switch safe implementation of these counters.  Within VxWorks this could be solved using a counting semaphore.  In the TMALI CSC design a faster method was used by using a free running error counter and a careful update of the reported number of errors, using an extra temporary variable.  As the increment and assignment of the 32 bit unsigned integers themselves are atomic operations the resulting counters are task safe and no error events are lost.  This means that the sum of the errors reported by the tmaliHkGet() function is equal to the total numbers of errors that occurred, no error reports are lost due to the update of the internal structures.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.006199107,0.07520387,1.098612289,0.257338449,5.4821216,1.663986811,36.06967223,13.57506572,0.988235294,7.963555629,0.016891829,0.194185511,0.337836573,0.047498722,0.254096908,4.037186148,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003799453,0.041779928,1.098612289,0.191539069,0.854928886,0,56.7518566,9.860318658,1,10.91659713,0.01858626,0.264096993,2.00731606,0.070066873,0.192161671,4.019381524,0

  The DPU-SSI shall provide the capability for an application program to set the Inter-Block Gap (IBG) Timeout for transmitted and received messages.,"Control and Monitoringthe CCM Control Task initializes the DPU FSW. It is the responsibility of the CCM Control Task to establish a successful boot.  It does so by blocking on temporary semaphores, each with a 5 second timeout, after spawning the SCU Interface Task and the CCM Command Task.  If both of these tasks report a successful initialization by giving the semaphore, the CCM Control Task toggles the BC_INDEX parameter in EEPROM to indicate a successful boot.  If either task does not report a successful initialization, the CCM Control Task disables the watchdog strobe to effect a reboot of the DPU.  The rationale for selecting the successful initialization of these two tasks as the definition of a successful boot is that the DPU FSW requires these tasks, as a minimum, to establish ground contact and provide commandability.Once this initialization is complete, the task blocks on a binary semaphore which is given by the SCUI Command ISR upon arrival of the 1 Hz Clock Message.  In the event a Clock Message does not arrive, the semaphore will time out after 1.5 seconds.

The initial value for the frame depth setting is determined by the parameter provided when starting the tmaliTask.

This minimizes the chance of changing the setting while the hardware is close to detecting a frame event.  Changing the frame depth while the DCI CSC is processing data could cause unpredictable results.

 The DPU-DPA shall be able to perform tracking based on data collected from the detector by calculating the spacecraft drift using successive tracking frames using the algorithm described in Appendix C.,"Data Transfer to QueueWhen the tmaliTransferToQueueISR() ISR is invoked, it gives a semaphore to awaken tmaliTask() that will transfer data to the  queue over the VME bus.  The tmaliTask() uses the read() function in the DCI Driver, which implements a data transfer using a high speed assembly language routine.  Because the TMALI ring buffer is implemented as an array, the tmaliTask() function must first examine the TMALI_EVENT_QUEUE to determine whether the data resident in the DCI buffer can be retrieved using a single read() call, or whether two calls are required in order to correctly handle the wrap-around case at the end of the ring buffer.  In addition, the tmaliTask() function must perform an error check to verify that there is sufficient space to receive the data available in the Ping-Pong buffer.  If there is insufficient space for the complete set of frames, the entire contents of the readable Ping-Pong buffer are discarded and the error S_TMALI_QUEUE_FULL is reported using ccmErrEnq mechanism.  Such discarded data constitutes an integral number of CCD frames, since the DCI hardware design ensures that Ping-Pong transitions occur at CCD frame boundaries.

To update a single value in the list, an application must call the update function adcUpdateNext().  The ADC hardware only has a single A/D channel, and so to perform an A/D conversion the hardware requires a multiplexer setup and corresponding settle time, as well as the normal A/D conversion time.  Therefore, it takes two calls to adcUpdateNext() to update a single value in the list.

 The DPU compression software shall report errors to the DPU-CCM for inclusion in the DPU Housekeeping information.,"Data Transfer to QueueWhen the tmaliTransferToQueueISR() ISR is invoked, it gives a semaphore to awaken tmaliTask() that will transfer data to the  queue over the VME bus.  The tmaliTask() uses the read() function in the DCI Driver, which implements a data transfer using a high speed assembly language routine.  Because the TMALI ring buffer is implemented as an array, the tmaliTask() function must first examine the TMALI_EVENT_QUEUE to determine whether the data resident in the DCI buffer can be retrieved using a single read() call, or whether two calls are required in order to correctly handle the wrap-around case at the end of the ring buffer.  In addition, the tmaliTask() function must perform an error check to verify that there is sufficient space to receive the data available in the Ping-Pong buffer.  If there is insufficient space for the complete set of frames, the entire contents of the readable Ping-Pong buffer are discarded and the error S_TMALI_QUEUE_FULL is reported using ccmErrEnq mechanism.  Such discarded data constitutes an integral number of CCD frames, since the DCI hardware design ensures that Ping-Pong transitions occur at CCD frame boundaries.

" The DPU-SCUI shall be capable of preparing one STPDU for delivery to the SCU every M milliseconds, or shall indicate a No Data condition to the SCU by maintaining an un-incremented ST_PDU Transfer Request Counter field.","Control and Monitoringthe CCM Control Task initializes the DPU FSW. It is the responsibility of the CCM Control Task to establish a successful boot.  It does so by blocking on temporary semaphores, each with a 5 second timeout, after spawning the SCU Interface Task and the CCM Command Task.  If both of these tasks report a successful initialization by giving the semaphore, the CCM Control Task toggles the BC_INDEX parameter in EEPROM to indicate a successful boot.  If either task does not report a successful initialization, the CCM Control Task disables the watchdog strobe to effect a reboot of the DPU.  The rationale for selecting the successful initialization of these two tasks as the definition of a successful boot is that the DPU FSW requires these tasks, as a minimum, to establish ground contact and provide commandability.Once this initialization is complete, the task blocks on a binary semaphore which is given by the SCUI Command ISR upon arrival of the 1 Hz Clock Message.  In the event a Clock Message does not arrive, the semaphore will time out after 1.5 seconds.

Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().

"  There DPU-DPA shall have three science modes, X, Y mode, and X/Y mode.","Sending Messages to the ICUSome special processing and checking is required in this function to handle the transmission of the ACK/NAK message.  When a command arrives from the ICU, the icuiCmdReceiveISR() will verify the message checksum and then send an ACK/NAK message to the ICU.  It is possible that an application is in the midst of sending a message to the ICU at the time a command interrupt occurs.  However, since it is not possible for an ISR to take a semaphore, an additional mechanism is required in order to provide mutual exclusion between a task an the ISR.  To accommodate this problem, the icuiEnq() function first determines whether it is being invoked from interrupt context.  If so, it then tests the value of a static variable, icuiEnqBusy.

 The DPU-CCM shall use DPU-EEPRM to access the EEPROM.,"Receiving Commands from the ICUThe interface to the ICU is via a synchronous serial interface (SSI) bus, which utilizes an inter-block gap (IBG) to delineate complete messages from one another.  The DPU hardware produces an interrupt when it detects an IBG, and the SSI Driver provides a mechanism by which an application can install an interrupt hook routine to respond to an IBG interrupt.  Upon initialization, the ICUI CSC installs a hook routine into the SSI Driver called icuiCommandReceiveISR(), which verifies the checksum of an incoming command, transmits an ACK/NAK message to the ICU, and then enqueues the command for later processing by calling ccmCmdEnq().

The DPU-BOOT CSC shall disable write-protection of the EEPROM on the SCM.,"Public FunctionsThis function sets the frame depth of the Ping-Pong buffers used by the DCI CSC.  The frame depth determines how many frames are read into the selected Ping-Pong buffer before interrupting.  The initial value for the frame depth setting is determined by the parameter provided when starting the tmaliTask.  The maximum value to which the frame depth can be commanded is 64 frames, an attempt to command the frame depth to a value larger than this maximum will result in setting the timeout to the default value of V frames.The actual setting of the frame depth could be delayed by a small amount of time if there is activity on the DCI bus, and is typically changed when the DCI has just reported a frame level reached or timeout condition.  This minimizes the chance of changing the setting while the hardware is close to detecting a frame event.  Changing the frame depth while the DCI CSC is processing data could cause unpredictable results.  When a new tmaliDciFrameDepthSet command is send before the previous setting has been activated the new request will overwrite the previous request and the DCI will be commanded to the new value at the first available opportunity.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.006199107,0.036860464,0.405465108,0.12225233,9.677379405,3.445610239,36.06967223,12.88462771,0.964705882,7.648402949,0.004147446,0.023582646,0.045621908,0.043001358,0.187770496,2.57084908,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003926101,0.037676762,1.098612289,0.187451749,0.948160871,0,56.7518566,13.24042601,1,8.221990727,0.029594683,0.347956934,3.225820407,0.069780494,0.283207908,4.424846632,0

This task blocks on a semaphore which is given by ccmCmdEnq(). The ccmCmdTask() wakes on the semaphore and calls ccmCmdProcess() to process waiting commands.  The ccmCmdProcess() function subsequently retrieves waiting commands from the Command Queue and invokes ccmCmdDispatch() to verify the expected length of the command and execute it.

"  The Bootstrap CSC shall address hardware modules as defined in document 1400, Company X Specification for the Company X Communication/Memory Module.","Transmit Message Mode(FIOSSIBGTXMSGENABLE) and Inter-Block Gap interruptsThe SSI Driver CSC supports a message mode to facilitate application level communication.  This mode uses the Inter-Block Gap interrupt generated by the hardware to synchronize message transmission. When in a messaging mode, the driver enables an internal Byte Count queue provides a synchronization mechanism for sending messages.  This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Transmit Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI.  In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued to the Byte Count queue.  When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be asserted.  At this time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a Byte Transfer Limit for this block and enabling the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt.  The Byte Transfer Limit corresponds to the entry on the Byte Count queue.  When all bytes in the current block have been sent up to the Byte Transfer Limit, the Tx FIFO ISR will disable itself and reset the Byte Transfer Limit to zero.

The tmaliTask() uses the read() function in the DCI Driver, which implements a data transfer using a high speed assembly language routine.  Because the TMALI ring buffer is implemented as an array, the tmaliTask() function must first examine the TMALI_EVENT_QUEUE to determine whether the data resident in the DCI buffer can be retrieved using a single read() call, or whether two calls are required in order to correctly handle the wrap-around case at the end of the ring buffer.  In addition, the tmaliTask() function must perform an error check to verify that there is sufficient space to receive the data available in the Ping-Pong buffer.  If there is insufficient space for the complete set of frames, the entire contents of the readable Ping-Pong buffer are discarded and the error S_TMALI_QUEUE_FULL is reported using ccmErrEnq mechanism.  Such discarded data constitutes an integral number of CCD frames, since the DCI hardware design ensures that Ping-Pong transitions occur at CCD frame boundaries.

  The DPU-ADC shall read from the SCM registers in B-bit words only.,"DRAM BITPart of the memory is tested in Boot Sequence 1, and part of the memory is tested during Boot Sequence 2.  During Boot Sequence 1, ? KB of DRAM is tested before the Bootstrap is copied to this area.  During Boot Sequence 2, the  remaining memory is tested in ? KB blocks. The DRAM BIT first writes the address of each word in a block to that word in the block.   Then the test flushes the cache and reads back the entire block.  If a single-bit error occurs on the read-back, the location is read again.  If another single-bit error occurs, the test assumes a hard error and marks the whole block bad.  If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.  This same process is repeated with the ones complement of the address. The Bootstrap stores the results of the DRAM BIT in EEPROM as a series of x consecutive y-bit words.  Each bit in a result word represents the result of testing a ? KB block of DRAM.

  The DPU-BOOT CSC shall include a DRAM BIT consisting of two write/read/compare tests.  The first test shall write the address of each memory location to that location.  The second test shall write the complement of each memory location to that location.,"Sending Messages to the ICUSome special processing and checking is required in this function to handle the transmission of the ACK/NAK message.  When a command arrives from the ICU, the icuiCmdReceiveISR() will verify the message checksum and then send an ACK/NAK message to the ICU.  It is possible that an application is in the midst of sending a message to the ICU at the time a command interrupt occurs.  However, since it is not possible for an ISR to take a semaphore, an additional mechanism is required in order to provide mutual exclusion between a task an the ISR.  To accommodate this problem, the icuiEnq() function first determines whether it is being invoked from interrupt context.  If so, it then tests the value of a static variable, icuiEnqBusy.  If the variable is set, the function will save the given ACK/NAK message parameters in static variables and return.  If the variable is not set, the function will continue as normal (avoiding the semTake() and semGive() calls).  In normal execution, the icuiEnqBusy variable is set on entry and negated on exit, after which the static variables containing the ACK/NAK message parameters will be checked to determine whether an ACK/NAK is pending.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005353774,0.031189624,0.405465108,0.110183719,7.339167875,2.918193363,55.7315033,13.14397137,1,6.146267605,0.004991836,0.023582646,0.129787748,0.042770624,0.409828231,3.344038968,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.004206537,0.031607592,1.098612289,0.16174306,1.728186618,0,56.7518566,11.10910941,1,8.606971408,0.019860805,0.191682963,2.144966942,0.071169729,0.231761947,4.019381524,0

  The DPU-SSI shall provide the capability for an application program to set the Inter-Block Gap (IBG) Timeout for transmitted and received messages.,"Command and Control CSCThe Command and Control (CCM) CSC is a Level 2 reuse component from the INSTRUMENT Y project.  The Command and Control CSC includes the following components:* A Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), which initializes the DPU FSW and spawns other tasks at bootup, schedules the production of DPU housekeeping data packets, monitors the execution of other tasks, and schedules the execution of other periodic tasks such as the heartbeat message and the watchdog strobe; and* A Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask(), which receives and dispatches real-time commands received from the SCU or the ICU.Major data structures include:* A Static Data table that keeps track of the operational state.  Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.004907626,0.07520387,1.098612289,0.257338449,7.816951772,2.261728712,36.06967223,11.49054751,0.988235294,4.599431073,0.003876901,0.023582646,0.077538021,0.043852151,0.450457978,5.135798437,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003099554,0.036267334,1.098612289,0.184812134,-0.311045788,0,56.7518566,12.13363282,1,11.45844262,0.030960711,0.667402216,5.727731487,0.073897037,0.214503692,5.117993812,0
 The DPU-DCI shall provide an application program with the ability to toggle the hardware interface between Normal mode and Test mode.,"Performing Analog-to-Digital ConversionsThe ADC Driver maintains an array of ADC_LIST_ENTRY data structures which contain the hardware multiplexer setup information for each of the x analog inputs, and the current value (ADC_VALUE) of each analog input.  To update a single value in the list, an application must call the update function adcUpdateNext().  The ADC hardware only has a single A/D channel, and so to perform an A/D conversion the hardware requires a multiplexer setup and corresponding settle time, as well as the normal A/D conversion time.  Therefore, it takes two calls to adcUpdateNext() to update a single value in the list.  To keep the driver simple and to avoid embedding hard waits in the driver, the application is required to implement the setup and conversion time by spacing successive calls to the adcUpdateNext() function appropriately.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005353774,0.07520387,1.098612289,0.257338449,7.782045713,3.818236045,36.06967223,11.31408325,0.988235294,6.07585254,0.004573251,0.023582646,0.091465019,0.04426119,0.313535748,3.749504076,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003926101,0.037601935,1.098612289,0.182444352,0.554939645,0,56.7518566,15.08597561,1,12.55190081,0.036837016,0.667402216,2.946961263,0.066646308,0.194516367,5.117993812,0

When the caller supplied pointer to a TMALI_HK structure is NIL no data is returned but the tmali internal counters are still reset to zero.Two of the four error counters are updated within an ISR context, this requires a task switch safe implementation of these counters.  Within VxWorks this could be solved using a counting semaphore.  In the TMALI CSC design a faster method was used by using a free running error counter and a careful update of the reported number of errors, using an extra temporary variable.  As the increment and assignment of the 32 bit unsigned integers themselves are atomic operations the resulting counters are task safe and no error events are lost.  This means that the sum of the errors reported by the tmaliHkGet() function is equal to the total numbers of errors that occurred, no error reports are lost due to the update of the internal structures.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005121002,0.120787267,1.098612289,0.323503811,9.003659511,1.944348907,55.7315033,15.00801128,1,7.435027396,0.009145925,0.1735345,0.310961437,0.04361211,0.266313506,2.93857386,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003799453,0.041779928,1.098612289,0.191539069,0.854928886,0,56.7518566,9.860318658,1,10.91659713,0.01858626,0.264096993,2.00731606,0.070066873,0.192161671,4.019381524,0
  The Bootstrap Monitor of the DPU-BOOT CSC shall provide the capability to load a configuration of the DPU-RTOS from EEPROM to DRAM and start its execution on command.,"Install Exception Handlers Certain conditions can cause the VxWorks? exception handler to reboot the DPU.  These conditions include a Data Storage Interrupt from within an interrupt context, a Multiple-Bit Error (MBE), and a deferred-work queue overrun.  Under these circumstances, interrupting devices on the Company X Communication/Memory Module must be stopped prior to jumping back to the Bootstrap.  This can be done by installing a hook routine to perform the cleanup in sysHwInit() using the function rebootHookAdd().  However, to avoid the need to cleanup interrupts, an exception handler is installed which forces a watchdog reset, which will effectively clean up the pending interrupt problem.  The exception hook saves the contents of the Exception Stack Frame to EEPROM and waits for a watchdog timeout.

  The DPU-DCI shall read from the DCI Registers in C-bit words only,"Public FunctionsThis function sets the frame depth of the Ping-Pong buffers used by the DCI CSC.  The frame depth determines how many frames are read into the selected Ping-Pong buffer before interrupting.  The initial value for the frame depth setting is determined by the parameter provided when starting the tmaliTask.  The maximum value to which the frame depth can be commanded is 64 frames, an attempt to command the frame depth to a value larger than this maximum will result in setting the timeout to the default value of V frames.The actual setting of the frame depth could be delayed by a small amount of time if there is activity on the DCI bus, and is typically changed when the DCI has just reported a frame level reached or timeout condition.

  The DPU-DPA shall be capable of collecting detector events over the full  FOV.,"Control and Monitoringthe CCM Control Task initializes the DPU FSW. It is the responsibility of the CCM Control Task to establish a successful boot.  It does so by blocking on temporary semaphores, each with a 5 second timeout, after spawning the SCU Interface Task and the CCM Command Task.  If both of these tasks report a successful initialization by giving the semaphore, the CCM Control Task toggles the BC_INDEX parameter in EEPROM to indicate a successful boot.  If either task does not report a successful initialization, the CCM Control Task disables the watchdog strobe to effect a reboot of the DPU.  The rationale for selecting the successful initialization of these two tasks as the definition of a successful boot is that the DPU FSW requires these tasks, as a minimum, to establish ground contact and provide commandability.Once this initialization is complete, the task blocks on a binary semaphore which is given by the SCUI Command ISR upon arrival of the 1 Hz Clock Message.  In the event a Clock Message does not arrive, the semaphore will time out after 1.5 seconds.  The CCM Control Task remains alive to create and transmit DPU housekeeping at the appropriate intervals, perform various periodic processing tasks, and to process memory dump commands.The final call to ccmErrEnq() is performed in order that if an error occurs in an interrupt service routine, a global variable is set to the value of the errno which is then enqueued into the Error/Event Queue as part of this tasks normal processing.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.006199107,0.031189624,0.405465108,0.112455788,6.940943479,2.68997609,36.06967223,10.59957665,0.958823529,8.544554312,0.002934644,0.023582646,0.038150377,0.045971038,0.318421834,2.32238772,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.00368072,0.024039577,1.098612289,0.141547722,0.173077824,0,56.7518566,12.20037601,1,9.992394568,0.0314774,0.543364868,4.469790804,0.072135516,0.237322453,4.424846632,0

To accommodate this problem, the icuiEnq() function first determines whether it is being invoked from interrupt context.  If so, it then tests the value of a static variable, icuiEnqBusy.  If the variable is set, the function will save the given ACK/NAK message parameters in static variables and return.  If the variable is not set, the function will continue as normal (avoiding the semTake() and semGive() calls).  In normal execution, the icuiEnqBusy variable is set on entry and negated on exit, after which the static variables containing the ACK/NAK message parameters will be checked to determine whether an ACK/NAK is pending.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005121002,0.1074341,1.098612289,0.305055066,7.852655321,0.681497383,55.7315033,15.67138003,1,9.136937145,0.005318584,0.023582646,0.074460173,0.055307461,0.447171154,3.749504076,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.004206537,0.031607592,1.098612289,0.16174306,1.728186618,0,56.7518566,11.10910941,1,8.606971408,0.019860805,0.191682963,2.144966942,0.071169729,0.231761947,4.019381524,0

The SSI Driver CSC is implemented on top of the VxWorks tyLib library to manage its ring buffers.   The driver features a standard I/O interface which utilizes an extended ioctl() command set to support unique SSI hardware attributes.  This driver is patterned after the older VxWorks 5.2 serial driver architecture rather than the newer Tornado serial driver architecture due to the lack of programmer control over I/O in the newer Tornado driver architecture. ,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.004362335,0.068088459,1.098612289,0.216202032,7.800143539,3.042804972,55.7315033,12.23096054,1,5.625584959,0.003737721,0.023582646,0.127082513,0.047036093,0.290910797,4.037186148,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003926101,0.065186779,1.098612289,0.243692822,2.925991533,0,56.7518566,13.2141752,1,11.22066503,0.018543449,0.324992878,1.168237291,0.066948628,0.225778705,3.172083663,0
  The DPU-BOOT CSC shall provide a monitor which accepts commands over the RS-232 interface.,"Sending Messages to the ICUSome special processing and checking is required in this function to handle the transmission of the ACK/NAK message.  When a command arrives from the ICU, the icuiCmdReceiveISR() will verify the message checksum and then send an ACK/NAK message to the ICU.  It is possible that an application is in the midst of sending a message to the ICU at the time a command interrupt occurs.  However, since it is not possible for an ISR to take a semaphore, an additional mechanism is required in order to provide mutual exclusion between a task an the ISR.  To accommodate this problem, the icuiEnq() function first determines whether it is being invoked from interrupt context.  If so, it then tests the value of a static variable, icuiEnqBusy.  If the variable is set, the function will save the given ACK/NAK message parameters in static variables and return.  If the variable is not set, the function will continue as normal (avoiding the semTake() and semGive() calls).  In normal execution, the icuiEnqBusy variable is set on entry and negated on exit, after which the static variables containing the ACK/NAK message parameters will be checked to determine whether an ACK/NAK is pending.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005353774,0.057923587,0.405465108,0.147239188,9.118301175,2.209984076,55.7315033,17.10963449,1,6.081518638,0.008794192,0.033944908,0.123118693,0.045334593,0.399233743,4.442651256,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.004206537,0.031607592,1.098612289,0.16174306,1.728186618,0,56.7518566,11.10910941,1,8.606971408,0.019860805,0.191682963,2.144966942,0.071169729,0.231761947,4.019381524,0

 The DPU-TMALI shall install a callback routine to respond to the DCI Error Interrupt.,"Public FunctionsThis routine gets housekeeping data stored for the TMALI CSC including some DCI parameters and resets the tmali internal counters to zero.  When the caller supplied pointer to a TMALI_HK structure is NIL no data is returned but the tmali internal counters are still reset to zero.Two of the four error counters are updated within an ISR context, this requires a task switch safe implementation of these counters.  Within VxWorks this could be solved using a counting semaphore.  In the TMALI CSC design a faster method was used by using a free running error counter and a careful update of the reported number of errors, using an extra temporary variable.  As the increment and assignment of the 32 bit unsigned integers themselves are atomic operations the resulting counters are task safe and no error events are lost.  This means that the sum of the errors reported by the tmaliHkGet() function is equal to the total numbers of errors that occurred, no error reports are lost due to the update of the internal structures.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.006543502,0.062379247,0.405465108,0.152265856,11.37541551,4.584657313,55.7315033,17.7453456,1,6.518673347,0.009463341,0.063125291,0.123023433,0.04600969,0.253941573,2.427748236,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.003799453,0.041779928,1.098612289,0.191539069,0.854928886,0,56.7518566,9.860318658,1,10.91659713,0.01858626,0.264096993,2.00731606,0.070066873,0.192161671,4.019381524,0

  The DPU-BOOT CSC shall attempt to complete its normal execution sequence following detection of any failure.,"Control and Monitoringthe CCM Control Task initializes the DPU FSW. It is the responsibility of the CCM Control Task to establish a successful boot.  It does so by blocking on temporary semaphores, each with a 5 second timeout, after spawning the SCU Interface Task and the CCM Command Task.  If both of these tasks report a successful initialization by giving the semaphore, the CCM Control Task toggles the BC_INDEX parameter in EEPROM to indicate a successful boot.  If either task does not report a successful initialization, the CCM Control Task disables the watchdog strobe to effect a reboot of the DPU.  The rationale for selecting the successful initialization of these two tasks as the definition of a successful boot is that the DPU FSW requires these tasks, as a minimum, to establish ground contact and provide commandability.Once this initialization is complete, the task blocks on a binary semaphore which is given by the SCUI Command ISR upon arrival of the 1 Hz Clock Message.  In the event a Clock Message does not arrive, the semaphore will time out after 1.5 seconds.  The CCM Control Task remains alive to create and transmit DPU housekeeping at the appropriate intervals, perform various periodic processing tasks, and to process memory dump commands.The final call to ccmErrEnq() is performed in order that if an error occurs in an interrupt service routine, a global variable is set to the value of the errno which is then enqueued into the Error/Event Queue as part of this tasks normal processing.",0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005121002,0,0,0,4.381644826,2.030073023,22.72863024,7.815257548,0.958823529,6.984225798,0.004814027,0.023582646,0.077024433,0.048094865,0.424833487,2.363209715,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.00368072,0.024039577,1.098612289,0.141547722,0.173077824,0,56.7518566,12.20037601,1,9.992394568,0.0314774,0.543364868,4.469790804,0.072135516,0.237322453,4.424846632,0
