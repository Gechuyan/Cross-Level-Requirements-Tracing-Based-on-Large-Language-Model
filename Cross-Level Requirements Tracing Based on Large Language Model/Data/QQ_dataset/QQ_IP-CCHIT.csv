Functional Safety Architecture The functional safety architecture separates operation from error/fault detection  with a few exceptions. This allows safety requirements to be more easily achieved and verified. Components comprising the functional safety architecture are: Upstream Monitor Downstream Monitor Pump Fault Manager Alarm Thread  Error Detector Fault Logger  Failure LED  Power Control,power and battery failure. Because with either working battery or power supply can operate the pump if the battery failure alarm and either the voltage out-o-range or the power supply failure alarms the the pump rate will be off otherwise the pump rate will continue at its previous value,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.004711321,0.042434278,1.098612289,0.181829266,0.31906605,0,50.24129944,13.40406858,1,13.21935115,0.023605247,0.272142585,1.062236134,0.063538609,1.335552106,4.983606622,0.405465108,0.348237453,0.005121002,0.013515504,0.405465108,0.074027462,0.474470192,0,11.57357478,4.403189409,0.964912281,8.518179435,0.029387514,0.107858441,0.881625419,0.049048047,0.657270383,4.043051268,0
