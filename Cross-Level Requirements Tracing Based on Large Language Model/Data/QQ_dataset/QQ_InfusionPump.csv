Safety Subsystem: Fault Logger The fault logger records all errors that are detected. As such it is pure hardware that does not depend on thread execution. It also maintains a hardware real-time clock used for timestamps,power and battery failure. Because with either working battery or power supply can operate the pump if the battery failure alarm and either the voltage out-o-range or the power supply failure alarms the the pump rate will be off otherwise the pump rate will continue at its previous value,0.4054651081081644,0.3482374531411765,0.004907626485682645,0.05616301484954231,1.0986122886681098,0.2080579176751291,0.08699891570922581,0.0,18.242196694830348,6.9439974783838485,1.0,12.169500450831354,0.03102076560484182,0.31285129517246374,1.0547060305646219,0.05076396002321341,0.4629604994688398,4.007333185232471,0.4054651081081644,0.3482374531411765,0.005121001550277543,0.01351550360360548,0.4054651081081644,0.07402746199737081,0.49199021872024723,0.17851484095136777,2.606135148606492,0.6509260720173755,0.9166666666666666,8.794483374730685,0.005991808948258088,0.025568414689925257,0.17975426844774264,0.04039759549141016,0.5644978747865046,2.4849066497880004,0

Safety Subsystem: Fault Logger The fault logger records all errors that are detected. As such it is pure hardware that does not depend on thread execution. It also maintains a hardware real-time clock used for timestamps,remaining battery minutes.
