The DPU hardware is designed to latch in the new time on the rising edge of the next 1 PPS signal (the act of writing a new time to the hardware registers arms the latch function in the hardware).  Once the new time is latched, the hardware automatically disables the time latch function to avoid the potential of latching in an old time at the next 1 PPS signal.will be received within one second.

If the command sent to ccmCmdEnq() is either a 1 Hz Clock Time message or an Attitude message from the spacecraft, the command will not be forwarded to the Command Queue, but instead will be executed directly while still in interrupt context.  Attitude messages are forwarded to dpaCommandSend(), while the 1 Hz Clock Time messages parameters are passed to tisTimeSync() in order to synchronize the current time.  Any other non DPU or spacecraft observatory messages are quietly discarded without reporting an error.In order to guarantee that ccmCmdTask() task reports in with the CCM Control Task periodically in absence of a ground command, the semaphore has a timeout value of 20 seconds.  If the semaphore times out, the task will verify no commands are on the Command Queue, and then report in to the CCM Control Task by calling ccmTaskReport().",1
  The DPU-CCM shall maintain counts of both the number of commands successfully received and rejected and report the parameters in DPU_HK.,"Error Collection and ReportingThe ccmErrEnq() function tracks the last error reported and its frequency of occurrence.  Once an error code has been reported it becomes the previously reported error code maintained by ccmErrEnq().  A repetition count is then incremented for each subsequent, consecutively reported, identical instance of this previously reported error.  If this error code is reported more than once in one high-rate housekeeping reporting period, then a special error, S_ccm_ERR_REPEAT is enqueued with the repetition count for the error encoded in the least significant byte. This mechanism effectively reduces the potential for housekeeping telemetry to become flooded with a single repeated error.",1
  The DPU-CCM shall maintain counts of both the number of commands successfully received and rejected and report the parameters in DPU_HK.,"Public FunctionsThis routine gets housekeeping data stored for the TMALI CSC including some DCI parameters and resets the tmali internal counters to zero.  When the caller supplied pointer to a TMALI_HK structure is NIL no data is returned but the tmali internal counters are still reset to zero.Two of the four error counters are updated within an ISR context, this requires a task switch safe implementation of these counters.  Within VxWorks this could be solved using a counting semaphore.  In the TMALI CSC design a faster method was used by using a free running error counter and a careful update of the reported number of errors, using an extra temporary variable.  As the increment and assignment of the 32 bit unsigned integers themselves are atomic operations the resulting counters are task safe and no error events are lost.  This means that the sum of the errors reported by the tmaliHkGet() function is equal to the total numbers of errors that occurred, no error reports are lost due to the update of the internal structures.",1

The ring buffer uses two pointers called pIn and pOut to keep track of the data in the buffer. The pointers were defined such that reading from the buffer is the simplest operation and only a single compare is needed to verify if the buffer is empty.

The caller should store the value returned by this function in a variable defined locally within the scope of the function from which it is called.  If the return value is stored as described above, the EVENT value is stored in a RAD6000 register rather than memory.  Processing is therefore much faster since register accesses on the RAD6000 are much faster than memory accesses.A compilation option TMALI_NOCHECKS is provided for the disabling of buffer empty checks. This results in slightly faster code but should only be used when the application using this function is known to make proper calls to the function.  If the TMALI module is compiled with the TMALI_NOCHECKS option an improper call to the tmaliNextEvent function (calling it when no data is available in the TMALI buffer) will compromise the TMALI buffer data structure.The queue structure and the related pointers are described in the local tmaliP.h header file.

If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.  This same process is repeated with the ones complement of the address. The Bootstrap stores the results of the DRAM BIT in EEPROM as a series of x consecutive y-bit words.

The DPU hardware produces an interrupt when it detects an IBG, and the SSI Driver provides a mechanism by which an application can install an interrupt hook routine to respond to an IBG interrupt.

This mode uses the Inter-Block Gap interrupt generated by the hardware to synchronize message transmission. When in a messaging mode, the driver enables an internal Byte Count queue provides a synchronization mechanism for sending messages.  This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Transmit Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI.  In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued to the Byte Count queue.  When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be asserted.  At this time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a Byte Transfer Limit for this block and enabling the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt.  The Byte Transfer Limit corresponds to the entry on the Byte Count queue.  When all bytes in the current block have been sent up to the Byte Transfer Limit, the Tx FIFO ISR will disable itself and reset the Byte Transfer Limit to zero. An application may use this mode by calling write() with a buffer pointer and maxBytes in order to transfer a message of a particular length.",1

The API consists of the tmaliNextEvent() and tmaliWait() functions.* An set of API functions used by the DPA CSC to configure the DCI interface, including tmaliBitArrangementSet(), tmaliDciFrameDepthGet(), tmaliDciFrameDepthSet(), tmaliDciWindowSet(), tmaliDataTimeoutSet(), and tmaliDataTimeoutGet().* An API housekeeping function, tmaliHkGet(), which gathers  CSC housekeeping data at the request of the Command and Control Task.* The task tmaliTask() and an ISR tmaliTransferToQueueISR() work together via a semaphore to synchronize the transfer of data from the DCI to the  queueAn error handling ISR, tmaliDciErrorReportedISR(), is installed as a hook routine to the DCI Driver, and is used to keep track of the number of errors reported by the DCI driver.",1

  The DPU-DCI shall report errors to an application program by setting the ERRNO task variable and returning ERROR.,"Error Collection and ReportingThe DPU-CCM CSC provides a centralized error reporting interface, ccmErrEnq(), that other FSW tasks use to report errors.  Each time it wakes, ccmTask() checks to see if it is time to form an error/event packet for transmission to the ground.  If so, ccmTask() calls ccmHkMkError() to actually create the packet and forward it to DPU-SCUI for transmission to the ground.",1
  The DPU-DCI shall report errors to an application program by setting the ERRNO task variable and returning ERROR.,"Public FunctionsThis routine is called by any CSC in order to report an error or event that should be included in DPU housekeeping.  If this routine is called from interrupt context a static global variable, ccmISRError, is set so that the error can be enqueued later (see ccmCtrlTask()).  This is done since the error/event queue is semaphore-protected and a semaphore cannot be taken in an ISR.  The error queue semaphore has priority inversion set to reduce conflicts between multiple callers should a priority inversion situation arise. This routine also replaces frequently occuring errors with a special repeat error code.  The repeat error code is a special error code that follows a normally reported error code to indicate that the normally reported error code previously reported has occurred more than once in the last high rate reporting period",1

The ring buffer uses two pointers called pIn and pOut to keep track of the data in the buffer. The pointers were defined such that reading from the buffer is the simplest operation and only a single compare is needed to verify if the buffer is empty. The buffer only stores Events so the pointers point to these four byte entities. As the DCI specifies all data in bytes, sizes have to be converted before reading data.",1

If the values are out of range, the prior values are retained and an error is reported.

Libwarc shall be memory safe and manage dynamic memory internally,"Control and Monitoringthe CCM Control Task initializes the DPU FSW. It is the responsibility of the CCM Control Task to establish a successful boot.  It does so by blocking on temporary semaphores, each with a 5 second timeout, after spawning the SCU Interface Task and the CCM Command Task.  If both of these tasks report a successful initialization by giving the semaphore, the CCM Control Task toggles the BC_INDEX parameter in EEPROM to indicate a successful boot.  If either task does not report a successful initialization, the CCM Control Task disables the watchdog strobe to effect a reboot of the DPU.  The rationale for selecting the successful initialization of these two tasks as the definition of a successful boot is that the DPU FSW requires these tasks, as a minimum, to establish ground contact and provide commandability.Once this initialization is complete, the task blocks on a binary semaphore which is given by the SCUI Command ISR upon arrival of the 1 Hz Clock Message.  In the event a Clock Message does not arrive, the semaphore will time out after 1.5 seconds.  The CCM Control Task remains alive to create and transmit DPU housekeeping at the appropriate intervals, perform various periodic processing tasks, and to process memory dump commands.The final call to ccmErrEnq() is performed in order that if an error occurs in an interrupt service routine, a global variable is set to the value of the errno which is then enqueued into the Error/Event Queue as part of this tasks normal processing.",0

Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.",0

During Boot Sequence 1, ? KB of DRAM is tested before the Bootstrap is copied to this area.  During Boot Sequence 2, the  remaining memory is tested in ? KB blocks. The DRAM BIT first writes the address of each word in a block to that word in the block.   Then the test flushes the cache and reads back the entire block.  If a single-bit error occurs on the read-back, the location is read again.  If another single-bit error occurs, the test assumes a hard error and marks the whole block bad.  If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.  This same process is repeated with the ones complement of the address. The Bootstrap stores the results of the DRAM BIT in EEPROM as a series of x consecutive y-bit words.  Each bit in a result word represents the result of testing a ? KB block of DRAM.  These bits are mapped to DRAM by proceeding from least-significant bit (LSb) to most-significant bit (MSb) as the addresses of the memory blocks increase.

Within VxWorks this could be solved using a counting semaphore.  In the TMALI CSC design a faster method was used by using a free running error counter and a careful update of the reported number of errors, using an extra temporary variable.  As the increment and assignment of the 32 bit unsigned integers themselves are atomic operations the resulting counters are task safe and no error events are lost.

The ccmCmdProcess() function subsequently retrieves waiting commands from the Command Queue and invokes ccmCmdDispatch() to verify the expected length of the command and execute it.  If command echo is enabled, ccmCmdDispatch() will call ccmHkMkCmdEcho() to blindly echo the command back to the ground.  Counts for both rejected and executed commands are maintained. If the command sent to ccmCmdEnq() is either a 1 Hz Clock Time message or an Attitude message from the spacecraft, the command will not be forwarded to the Command Queue, but instead will be executed directly while still in interrupt context.  Attitude messages are forwarded to dpaCommandSend(), while the 1 Hz Clock Time messages parameters are passed to tisTimeSync() in order to synchronize the current time.  Any other non DPU or spacecraft observatory messages are quietly discarded without reporting an error.In order to guarantee that ccmCmdTask() task reports in with the CCM Control Task periodically in absence of a ground command, the semaphore has a timeout value of 20 seconds.  If the semaphore times out, the task will verify no commands are on the Command Queue, and then report in to the CCM Control Task by calling ccmTaskReport().",0

Within VxWorks this could be solved using a counting semaphore.  In the TMALI CSC design a faster method was used by using a free running error counter and a careful update of the reported number of errors, using an extra temporary variable.  As the increment and assignment of the 32 bit unsigned integers themselves are atomic operations the resulting counters are task safe and no error events are lost.

The ccmHealthChk() function, called by ccmPerProcess() verifies the execution of other tasks by monitoring the amount of time that has elapsed since each task last reported.  Other tasks report their execution to the CCM Control Task by calling the function, ccmTaskReport(), providing their task index.  Each task has an expected execution frequency, and if a task does not execute as expected, an error is reported in DPU housekeeping.  If the Command Dispatch Task fails to report for an extended period, the DPU will execute a reboot, since it is impossible to command the DPU if this task is not executing, otherwise it will strobe the watchdog",0

Such responsibilities include analog to digital conversion updates, DPU task monitoring, ICU heartbeat message production, and watchdog strobe. The ccmHealthChk() function, called by ccmPerProcess() verifies the execution of other tasks by monitoring the amount of time that has elapsed since each task last reported.  Other tasks report their execution to the CCM Control Task by calling the function, ccmTaskReport(), providing their task index.  Each task has an expected execution frequency, and if a task does not execute as expected, an error is reported in DPU housekeeping.  If the Command Dispatch Task fails to report for an extended period, the DPU will execute a reboot, since it is impossible to command the DPU if this task is not executing, otherwise it will strobe the watchdog",0
  The DPU-TIS shall provide the capability for application programs to access the current UT_DELTA.,"Data Transfer to QueueWhen the tmaliTransferToQueueISR() ISR is invoked, it gives a semaphore to awaken tmaliTask() that will transfer data to the  queue over the VME bus.  The tmaliTask() uses the read() function in the DCI Driver, which implements a data transfer using a high speed assembly language routine.  Because the TMALI ring buffer is implemented as an array, the tmaliTask() function must first examine the TMALI_EVENT_QUEUE to determine whether the data resident in the DCI buffer can be retrieved using a single read() call, or whether two calls are required in order to correctly handle the wrap-around case at the end of the ring buffer.  In addition, the tmaliTask() function must perform an error check to verify that there is sufficient space to receive the data available in the Ping-Pong buffer.  If there is insufficient space for the complete set of frames, the entire contents of the readable Ping-Pong buffer are discarded and the error S_TMALI_QUEUE_FULL is reported using ccmErrEnq mechanism.  Such discarded data constitutes an integral number of CCD frames, since the DCI hardware design ensures that Ping-Pong transitions occur at CCD frame boundaries.

During Boot Sequence 1, ? KB of DRAM is tested before the Bootstrap is copied to this area.  During Boot Sequence 2, the  remaining memory is tested in ? KB blocks. The DRAM BIT first writes the address of each word in a block to that word in the block.   Then the test flushes the cache and reads back the entire block.  If a single-bit error occurs on the read-back, the location is read again.  If another single-bit error occurs, the test assumes a hard error and marks the whole block bad.  If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.  This same process is repeated with the ones complement of the address. The Bootstrap stores the results of the DRAM BIT in EEPROM as a series of x consecutive y-bit words.  Each bit in a result word represents the result of testing a ? KB block of DRAM.  These bits are mapped to DRAM by proceeding from least-significant bit (LSb) to most-significant bit (MSb) as the addresses of the memory blocks increase.

When a command arrives from the ICU, the icuiCmdReceiveISR() will verify the message checksum and then send an ACK/NAK message to the ICU.  It is possible that an application is in the midst of sending a message to the ICU at the time a command interrupt occurs.  However, since it is not possible for an ISR to take a semaphore, an additional mechanism is required in order to provide mutual exclusion between a task an the ISR.  To accommodate this problem, the icuiEnq() function first determines whether it is being invoked from interrupt context.  If so, it then tests the value of a static variable, icuiEnqBusy.  If the variable is set, the function will save the given ACK/NAK message parameters in static variables and return.  If the variable is not set, the function will continue as normal (avoiding the semTake() and semGive() calls).

The DPU-BOOT CSC shall test and clear DRAM on power-on using the COLD_MEM_SIZE obtained from the SYSTEM_BLOCK.,"DRAM BITPart of the memory is tested in Boot Sequence 1, and part of the memory is tested during Boot Sequence 2.  During Boot Sequence 1, ? KB of DRAM is tested before the Bootstrap is copied to this area.  During Boot Sequence 2, the  remaining memory is tested in ? KB blocks. The DRAM BIT first writes the address of each word in a block to that word in the block.   Then the test flushes the cache and reads back the entire block.  If a single-bit error occurs on the read-back, the location is read again.  If another single-bit error occurs, the test assumes a hard error and marks the whole block bad.  If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.  This same process is repeated with the ones complement of the address. The Bootstrap stores the results of the DRAM BIT in EEPROM as a series of x consecutive y-bit words.  Each bit in a result word represents the result of testing a ? KB block of DRAM.  These bits are mapped to DRAM by proceeding from least-significant bit (LSb) to most-significant bit (MSb) as the addresses of the memory blocks increase.  A set bit indicates that a block of DRAM has failed.  A clear bit indicates that a block of DRAM has passed the test.",0

 The DPU-SCUI shall report errors to the DPU-CCM for inclusion in the DPU Housekeeping information.,"Transmit Message Mode(FIOSSIBGTXMSGENABLE) and Inter-Block Gap interruptsThe SSI Driver CSC supports a message mode to facilitate application level communication.  This mode uses the Inter-Block Gap interrupt generated by the hardware to synchronize message transmission. When in a messaging mode, the driver enables an internal Byte Count queue provides a synchronization mechanism for sending messages.  This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Transmit Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI.  In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued to the Byte Count queue.  When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be asserted.  At this time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a Byte Transfer Limit for this block and enabling the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt.  The Byte Transfer Limit corresponds to the entry on the Byte Count queue.  When all bytes in the current block have been sent up to the Byte Transfer Limit, the Tx FIFO ISR will disable itself and reset the Byte Transfer Limit to zero.

When in a messaging mode, the driver enables an internal Byte Count queue provides a synchronization mechanism for sending messages.  This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Transmit Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI.  In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued to the Byte Count queue.  When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be asserted.  At this time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a Byte Transfer Limit for this block and enabling the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt.  The Byte Transfer Limit corresponds to the entry on the Byte Count queue.

For example, task 1.1 is a subtask of task 1.","Sending Messages to the ICUSome special processing and checking is required in this function to handle the transmission of the ACK/NAK message.  When a command arrives from the ICU, the icuiCmdReceiveISR() will verify the message checksum and then send an ACK/NAK message to the ICU.  It is possible that an application is in the midst of sending a message to the ICU at the time a command interrupt occurs.  However, since it is not possible for an ISR to take a semaphore, an additional mechanism is required in order to provide mutual exclusion between a task an the ISR.  To accommodate this problem, the icuiEnq() function first determines whether it is being invoked from interrupt context.  If so, it then tests the value of a static variable, icuiEnqBusy.  If the variable is set, the function will save the given ACK/NAK message parameters in static variables and return.  If the variable is not set, the function will continue as normal (avoiding the semTake() and semGive() calls).

Each MODIS Standard Product shall contain ECS core metadata with the content and format specified in DID 311.,"Control and Monitoringthe CCM Control Task initializes the DPU FSW. It is the responsibility of the CCM Control Task to establish a successful boot.  It does so by blocking on temporary semaphores, each with a 5 second timeout, after spawning the SCU Interface Task and the CCM Command Task.  If both of these tasks report a successful initialization by giving the semaphore, the CCM Control Task toggles the BC_INDEX parameter in EEPROM to indicate a successful boot.  If either task does not report a successful initialization, the CCM Control Task disables the watchdog strobe to effect a reboot of the DPU.  The rationale for selecting the successful initialization of these two tasks as the definition of a successful boot is that the DPU FSW requires these tasks, as a minimum, to establish ground contact and provide commandability.Once this initialization is complete, the task blocks on a binary semaphore which is given by the SCUI Command ISR upon arrival of the 1 Hz Clock Message.  In the event a Clock Message does not arrive, the semaphore will time out after 1.5 seconds.  The CCM Control Task remains alive to create and transmit DPU housekeeping at the appropriate intervals, perform various periodic processing tasks, and to process memory dump commands.The final call to ccmErrEnq() is performed in order that if an error occurs in an interrupt service routine, a global variable is set to the value of the errno which is then enqueued into the Error/Event Queue as part of this tasks normal processing.",0

Delete Tasks; Delete an existing task and all its associated information such as links to other tasks or knowledge on what resources are supposed to work on them.,"Command and Control CSCThe Command and Control (CCM) CSC is a Level 2 reuse component from the INSTRUMENT Y project.  The Command and Control CSC includes the following components:* A Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), which initializes the DPU FSW and spawns other tasks at bootup, schedules the production of DPU housekeeping data packets, monitors the execution of other tasks, and schedules the execution of other periodic tasks such as the heartbeat message and the watchdog strobe; and* A Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask(), which receives and dispatches real-time commands received from the SCU or the ICU.Major data structures include:* A Static Data table that keeps track of the operational state.  Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.",0

The tmaliTask() uses the read() function in the DCI Driver, which implements a data transfer using a high speed assembly language routine.  Because the TMALI ring buffer is implemented as an array, the tmaliTask() function must first examine the TMALI_EVENT_QUEUE to determine whether the data resident in the DCI buffer can be retrieved using a single read() call, or whether two calls are required in order to correctly handle the wrap-around case at the end of the ring buffer.  In addition, the tmaliTask() function must perform an error check to verify that there is sufficient space to receive the data available in the Ping-Pong buffer.  If there is insufficient space for the complete set of frames, the entire contents of the readable Ping-Pong buffer are discarded and the error S_TMALI_QUEUE_FULL is reported using ccmErrEnq mechanism.

It is the responsibility of the CCM Control Task to establish a successful boot.  It does so by blocking on temporary semaphores, each with a 5 second timeout, after spawning the SCU Interface Task and the CCM Command Task.  If both of these tasks report a successful initialization by giving the semaphore, the CCM Control Task toggles the BC_INDEX parameter in EEPROM to indicate a successful boot.  If either task does not report a successful initialization, the CCM Control Task disables the watchdog strobe to effect a reboot of the DPU.  The rationale for selecting the successful initialization of these two tasks as the definition of a successful boot is that the DPU FSW requires these tasks, as a minimum, to establish ground contact and provide commandability.Once this initialization is complete, the task blocks on a binary semaphore which is given by the SCUI Command ISR upon arrival of the 1 Hz Clock Message.  In the event a Clock Message does not arrive, the semaphore will time out after 1.5 seconds.  The CCM Control Task remains alive to create and transmit DPU housekeeping at the appropriate intervals, perform various periodic processing tasks, and to process memory dump commands.The final call to ccmErrEnq() is performed in order that if an error occurs in an interrupt service routine, a global variable is set to the value of the errno which is then enqueued into the Error/Event Queue as part of this tasks normal processing.",0

It is possible that an application is in the midst of sending a message to the ICU at the time a command interrupt occurs.  However, since it is not possible for an ISR to take a semaphore, an additional mechanism is required in order to provide mutual exclusion between a task an the ISR.  To accommodate this problem, the icuiEnq() function first determines whether it is being invoked from interrupt context.  If so, it then tests the value of a static variable, icuiEnqBusy.  If the variable is set, the function will save the given ACK/NAK message parameters in static variables and return.  If the variable is not set, the function will continue as normal (avoiding the semTake() and semGive() calls).

The dependency class provides functions to get the task and the human resource. ,0
  The DPU compression software shall forward compressed data  to DPU-SCUI.,power and battery failure. Because with either working battery or power supply can operate the pump if the battery failure alarm and either the voltage out-o-range or the power supply failure alarms the the pump rate will be off otherwise the pump rate will continue at its previous value,0
"  When commanded to event mode by the ICU,  the DPU-DPA shall be capable of collecting time-tagged photon events and producing a PROD_EVENT.",electronic tamper detection mechanisms. The PCA pump shall include electronic tamper detection mechanisms and shall record detected tampering attempts in the Fault Log and Event Log as well as issuing an authenticated ICE message,0
  The DPU-TIS shall provide the capability for an application program to select the active 1PPS signal.,"Ring buffer data structureThe  CSC maintains a FIFO implemented as a ring buffer to temporarily store the data received from the DCI before it is processed. The ring buffer uses two pointers called pIn and pOut to keep track of the data in the buffer. The pointers were defined such that reading from the buffer is the simplest operation and only a single compare is needed to verify if the buffer is empty. The buffer only stores Events so the pointers point to these four byte entities. As the DCI specifies all data in bytes, sizes have to be converted before reading data.",0
The system shall support audit capability,Libwarc shall be implemented to WARC v0.17.,0
  The Bootstrap Monitor of the DPU-BOOT CSC shall validate commands entered for syntax and number of arguments.,"Install Exception Handlers The RSC processor also generates an external interrupt for the Power Fail Interrupt.  The RSCVME Board Support Package of VxWorks? does not directly support access to this interrupt.  Some custom routines must be provided to access this interrupt. These functions are described below, and are contained in sysLibSup.c.",0
" The DPU-CCM shall spawn tasks for DPU-CCM, DPU-DPA, DPU-DCX, DPU-SCUI, and DPU-TMALI at bootup.",The system shall capture user and date stamp for all prescription related events,0
