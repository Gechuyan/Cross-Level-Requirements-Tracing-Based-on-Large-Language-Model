During Boot Sequence 1, ? KB of DRAM is tested before the Bootstrap is copied to this area.  During Boot Sequence 2, the  remaining memory is tested in ? KB blocks. The DRAM BIT first writes the address of each word in a block to that word in the block.   Then the test flushes the cache and reads back the entire block.  If a single-bit error occurs on the read-back, the location is read again.  If another single-bit error occurs, the test assumes a hard error and marks the whole block bad.  If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.  This same process is repeated with the ones complement of the address. The Bootstrap stores the results of the DRAM BIT in EEPROM as a series of x consecutive y-bit words.

During Boot Sequence 1, ? KB of DRAM is tested before the Bootstrap is copied to this area.  During Boot Sequence 2, the  remaining memory is tested in ? KB blocks. The DRAM BIT first writes the address of each word in a block to that word in the block.   Then the test flushes the cache and reads back the entire block.  If a single-bit error occurs on the read-back, the location is read again.  If another single-bit error occurs, the test assumes a hard error and marks the whole block bad.  If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.  This same process is repeated with the ones complement of the address. The Bootstrap stores the results of the DRAM BIT in EEPROM as a series of x consecutive y-bit words.  Each bit in a result word represents the result of testing a ? KB block of DRAM.  These bits are mapped to DRAM by proceeding from least-significant bit (LSb) to most-significant bit (MSb) as the addresses of the memory blocks increase.  A set bit indicates that a block of DRAM has failed.  A clear bit indicates that a block of DRAM has passed the test.",0

  The DPU-BIT shall perform MIL-STD-1553B internal BIT.,"DRAM BITPart of the memory is tested in Boot Sequence 1, and part of the memory is tested during Boot Sequence 2.  During Boot Sequence 1, ? KB of DRAM is tested before the Bootstrap is copied to this area.  During Boot Sequence 2, the  remaining memory is tested in ? KB blocks. The DRAM BIT first writes the address of each word in a block to that word in the block.   Then the test flushes the cache and reads back the entire block.  If a single-bit error occurs on the read-back, the location is read again.  If another single-bit error occurs, the test assumes a hard error and marks the whole block bad.  If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.  This same process is repeated with the ones complement of the address. The Bootstrap stores the results of the DRAM BIT in EEPROM as a series of x consecutive y-bit words.  Each bit in a result word represents the result of testing a ? KB block of DRAM.  These bits are mapped to DRAM by proceeding from least-significant bit (LSb) to most-significant bit (MSb) as the addresses of the memory blocks increase.

If a single-bit error occurs on the read-back, the location is read again.  If another single-bit error occurs, the test assumes a hard error and marks the whole block bad.  If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.  This same process is repeated with the ones complement of the address. The Bootstrap stores the results of the DRAM BIT in EEPROM as a series of x consecutive y-bit words.  Each bit in a result word represents the result of testing a ? KB block of DRAM.  These bits are mapped to DRAM by proceeding from least-significant bit (LSb) to most-significant bit (MSb) as the addresses of the memory blocks increase.  A set bit indicates that a block of DRAM has failed.  A clear bit indicates that a block of DRAM has passed the test.",1

The Bootstrap constructs a bit map which effectively implements a list of failed memory blocks during the bootstrap built-in test.  A set of functions have been created to utilize this  bit map to exclude failed memory blocks from the VxWorks system memory pool.  The system memory pool is used by VxWorks to allocate memory dynamically.  In addition, a linked list of good memory segments is created for use by the EDAC Memory Scrubber.  These functions are called from the usrInit() and usrRoot() functions in usrConfig.c.  The dramInit() function must be called prior to kernelInit() in usrInit().

In addition, the tmaliTask() function must perform an error check to verify that there is sufficient space to receive the data available in the Ping-Pong buffer.  If there is insufficient space for the complete set of frames, the entire contents of the readable Ping-Pong buffer are discarded and the error S_TMALI_QUEUE_FULL is reported using ccmErrEnq mechanism.

The error queue semaphore has priority inversion set to reduce conflicts between multiple callers should a priority inversion situation arise. This routine also replaces frequently occuring errors with a special repeat error code.  The repeat error code is a special error code that follows a normally reported error code to indicate that the normally reported error code previously reported has occurred more than once in the last high rate reporting period",1

This task blocks on a semaphore which is given by ccmCmdEnq(). The ccmCmdTask() wakes on the semaphore and calls ccmCmdProcess() to process waiting commands.  The ccmCmdProcess() function subsequently retrieves waiting commands from the Command Queue and invokes ccmCmdDispatch() to verify the expected length of the command and execute it.  If command echo is enabled, ccmCmdDispatch() will call ccmHkMkCmdEcho() to blindly echo the command back to the ground.  Counts for both rejected and executed commands are maintained. If the command sent to ccmCmdEnq() is either a 1 Hz Clock Time message or an Attitude message from the spacecraft, the command will not be forwarded to the Command Queue, but instead will be executed directly while still in interrupt context.  Attitude messages are forwarded to dpaCommandSend(), while the 1 Hz Clock Time messages parameters are passed to tisTimeSync() in order to synchronize the current time.  Any other non DPU or spacecraft observatory messages are quietly discarded without reporting an error.In order to guarantee that ccmCmdTask() task reports in with the CCM Control Task periodically in absence of a ground command, the semaphore has a timeout value of 20 seconds.

Within VxWorks this could be solved using a counting semaphore.  In the TMALI CSC design a faster method was used by using a free running error counter and a careful update of the reported number of errors, using an extra temporary variable.  As the increment and assignment of the 32 bit unsigned integers themselves are atomic operations the resulting counters are task safe and no error events are lost.

The caller should store the value returned by this function in a variable defined locally within the scope of the function from which it is called.

If a multiple-bit error occurs, the whole block is marked bad.  If the value read back does not match the address, the whole block is marked bad.

The Command and Control CSC includes the following components:* A Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), which initializes the DPU FSW and spawns other tasks at bootup, schedules the production of DPU housekeeping data packets, monitors the execution of other tasks, and schedules the execution of other periodic tasks such as the heartbeat message and the watchdog strobe; and* A Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask(), which receives and dispatches real-time commands received from the SCU or the ICU.Major data structures include:* A Static Data table that keeps track of the operational state.  Data included in this table includes housekeeping production rates, CCM specific flags, and the number of commands executed.* A Command Queue into which commands are placed when they arrive, via interrupt, from the ICU or the SCU.* An Error/Event Queue which accumulates error and event codes which are reported by the DPU FSW.  These error and event codes are removed from the queue and placed into a telemetry packet at a given interval and included in DPU housekeeping data.DPUSDS5.12.1.1.1Flight Software InitializationThe Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.",1

"  The DPU-DCI shall provide the capability for an application program to set a timeout in milliseconds that specifies a period during which no new events have been received by the hardware, after which the hardware will swap ping-pong buffers and interrupt the software.",Normal Data Exchange SequenceThe TMALI CSC serves as an intermediate manager of EVENT data supplied by the DCI Driver CSC and eventually delivered to the DPA CSC.  The TMALI CSC waits for notification from the DCI CSC that a frame limit (or data timeout) has been reached in the Ping-Pong buffer indicating the EVENT data is ready to be served to TMALI.   TMALI reads all EVENT data from the DCI and notifies the DCI that it can swap Ping-Pong buffers when ready.   TMALI gives a semaphore to unblock the tmaliWait() call from the DPA.,1
"  The DPU-DCI shall provide the capability for an application program to set a timeout in milliseconds that specifies a period during which no new events have been received by the hardware, after which the hardware will swap ping-pong buffers and interrupt the software.","Setting Data Timeout in DCIDuring nominal operation, frames arrive approximately every 11 msecs.  The DCI hardware will generate an interrupt if event data has been received in one of the Ping-Pong buffers, and a configurable amount of time has passed during which no additional events have been received.  A data timeout interrupt is not an error, but rather typically indicates that the current exposure has been completed.  The data timeout interrupt allows the TMALI CSC to retrieve the trailing events from the DCI Ping-Pong buffer.  The function tmaliDciTimeoutSet() provides an API to the DCI Driver to allow the timeout setting to be altered.",1

  The DPU-DCI shall report errors to an application program by setting the ERRNO task variable and returning ERROR.,"Error Collection and ReportingThe DPU-CCM CSC provides a centralized error reporting interface, ccmErrEnq(), that other FSW tasks use to report errors.  Each time it wakes, ccmTask() checks to see if it is time to form an error/event packet for transmission to the ground.  If so, ccmTask() calls ccmHkMkError() to actually create the packet and forward it to DPU-SCUI for transmission to the ground.",1
  The DPU-DCI shall report errors to an application program by setting the ERRNO task variable and returning ERROR.,"Public FunctionsThis routine is called by any CSC in order to report an error or event that should be included in DPU housekeeping.  If this routine is called from interrupt context a static global variable, ccmISRError, is set so that the error can be enqueued later (see ccmCtrlTask()).  This is done since the error/event queue is semaphore-protected and a semaphore cannot be taken in an ISR.  The error queue semaphore has priority inversion set to reduce conflicts between multiple callers should a priority inversion situation arise. This routine also replaces frequently occuring errors with a special repeat error code.  The repeat error code is a special error code that follows a normally reported error code to indicate that the normally reported error code previously reported has occurred more than once in the last high rate reporting period",1

"  The DPU-DCI shall read from the DCI Memory in B-bit words only, using the load multiple/store multiple instructions.","Ring buffer data structureThe  CSC maintains a FIFO implemented as a ring buffer to temporarily store the data received from the DCI before it is processed. The ring buffer uses two pointers called pIn and pOut to keep track of the data in the buffer. The pointers were defined such that reading from the buffer is the simplest operation and only a single compare is needed to verify if the buffer is empty. The buffer only stores Events so the pointers point to these four byte entities. As the DCI specifies all data in bytes, sizes have to be converted before reading data.",1
